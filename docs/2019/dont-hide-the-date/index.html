  	<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed an interesting (growing?) trend over the past few years. Some bloggers (or their designers) choose to hide <em>when</em> a post was written. I usually see this via dates excluded from the URL and/or the page itself. Why they&rsquo;re doing this, I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
<p>For URLs, I think dates are useful. Take this URL for example:</p>
<p>/2019/dont-hide-the-date</p>
<p>Just looking at it, you have a sense of when it was written and what it might be about. Instantly. That&rsquo;s a good user experience.</p>
<p>(My favorite URL approach is from sites like Medium, where they opt for the questionable /title-GI83R1SH article ID at the end of their post URLs which manages to thread the needle of being both impossible to guess and devoid of any date context. I call this URL style post-modern, because what starts out understandable quickly turns convoluted.)</p>
<p>But I understand not wanting extra cruft in your URLs. Having a clean website.com/post-title structure is attractive to my inner minimalist. Going title-only also makes it easier to recall the URL of a once-visited post, since you&rsquo;re more likely to guess the title of an article than the title and date.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s the date on the page itself. I generally see a lot of designs use the smallest type size or the faintest gray color possible—if they even include the date at all. I think that&rsquo;s the wrong way to go. Whether the post is timely or timeless, dates provide a sense of place and serve as an important piece of context for your readers.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to overemphasize the <em>when</em> something was written, but please don&rsquo;t leave it out completely.</p>
