  	<p>Chris Jones, <em>ESPN</em>, attempted to complete the medical and fitness review required of all Everton F.C. players. It did not go well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get this out of the way. I&rsquo;m supposed to say that my greatest source of pride is my children, but they haven&rsquo;t really done anything that special. They&rsquo;re regular kids, and there are billions of those. My greatest source of pride is that I still play competitive football at age 44. There are players in my league as young as 18. I&rsquo;ve privately hoped that one day I&rsquo;ll play alongside my youngest son, who is 10. Eight more years. That makes 52.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Luckily, I&rsquo;m a goalkeeper. Unluckily, I&rsquo;m short and fat. I&rsquo;m 5-foot-10 and 214 pounds. I worried that Everton wouldn&rsquo;t have a kit that fit me, and I searched for a comparably sized player. In other words, I looked up Wayne Rooney. He&rsquo;s a similar height but 30 pounds lighter. I warned Everton in advance that they would be outfitting Wayne Rooney&hellip; if Wayne Rooney were pregnant with twins.</p>
