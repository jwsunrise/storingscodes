  	<p>I&rsquo;ve recommended the code sharing/developer social network GitHub to many people (students and writers primarily), but the recommendation always came with the giant asterisk that everything you published would be public. It&rsquo;s nice that&rsquo;s no longer the case. GitHub becomes a far more attractive service—and stronger social network—when you can host <em>all</em> your work there.</p>
<p>This also makes a lot of sense for where Microsoft might want to take GitHub. The majority of GitHub&rsquo;s future revenue is likely to come in the form of lucrative Enterprise accounts at large companies—something Microsoft is well positioned to push—rather than free (née <em>personal</em>) accounts that upgrade to paid tiers.</p>
<p>(This came at a good time for me too as I wanted to—finally—get my project files for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1231744746">Edit</a> into their own GitHub repository. Hours after the announcement, I created a new private repository and got everything uploaded. This is going to make my development life so much better. Previously, the whole project was stuffed into a random Dropbox folder. The cobbler&rsquo;s kids have no shoes, right?)</p>
