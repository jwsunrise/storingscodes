<p>Good Universe is teaming with independent video game developer and publishing company Campo Santo to develop content for both video games and feature films. The companies will create a home for talent to develop projects that can bridge both the video game and feature film worlds. Their first project with be a film adaptation of Campo Santo’s first video game, <em>Firewatch</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Browsing through <a href="http://www.imdb.com/company/co0380492/">Good Universe&rsquo;s past work</a>, there&rsquo;s very little that carries the tone and cinematography I imagine a <em>Firewatch</em> film would have, but who&rsquo;s to say. I doubt many saw a Panic-backed video game either.</p>
<p>An interesting bit buried in Ms. Ford&rsquo;s piece is that <em>Firewatch</em> &ldquo;has sold almost 1 million copies to date.&rdquo; The last sales estimate I could find was from <a href="https://panic.com/blog/firewatch-one-month-later/">Panic&rsquo;s Cabel Sasser back in March</a>, where he pegged the number at &ldquo;around 500,000&rdquo;.</p>
