  	<p>To close us out for the night, here&rsquo;s co-creator of OpenType itself, Microsoft:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today, we are announcing the biggest enhancement to OpenType since the OpenType specification was first released nineteen years ago: OpenType Font Variations. [&hellip;]</p>
<p>Variable fonts will also give document creators a broad palette of typographic features without having to manage hundreds of font files. Variable fonts are all about doing more with less. [&hellip;]</p>
<p>The Windows engineering team at Microsoft is actively engaged in implementing platform support for OpenType Font Variations for release in an update to Windows in 2017. Some very-limited functionality is already present in the Windows 10 Anniversary Update, and more complete functionality will be visible in Windows Insider preview builds in the coming months.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nice to see an actual, albeit fuzzy, target date mixed in with all of the other co-announcements today. I also like the &ldquo;doing more with less&rdquo; part from above; it succinctly conveys what variable fonts are all about.</p>
<p>As for getting early access to variable fonts — well, that just might be this year&rsquo;s most compelling argument for installing Windows at all.</p>
