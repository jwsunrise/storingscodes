  	<p>DuckDuckGo, the privacy-focused search engine, just announced a new partnership with Yahoo. This partnership isn&rsquo;t necessarily new, perhaps more <em>renewed</em>, as DuckDuckGo has utilized Yahoo&rsquo;s BOSS (Build Your Own Search Service) API <a href="https://developer.yahoo.com/blogs/ydn/duckduckgo-search-engine-built-boss-47461.html">for years</a>. That said, I wasn&rsquo;t sure what DuckDuckGo was going to do when Yahoo announced it was <a href="https://developer.yahoo.com/boss/search/">discontinuing the BOSS API earlier this year</a>.</p>
<p>Now we know.</p>
<p>DuckDuckGo will continue to get results, and a few extra features like date filtering on results, from Yahoo by way of a custom integrations between each service. Here&rsquo;s the text over on the <em>Yahoo</em> subdomain <a href="https://duckduckgo-owned-server.yahoo.net">duckduckgo-owned-server.yahoo.net</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This DuckDuckGo owned server is operating on a subdomain (duckduckgo-owned-server.yahoo.net) that has been <a href="https://duck.co/help/results/yahoo-technical-implementation">delegated to DuckDuckGo via DNS</a> by Yahoo so that we can continue to protect your privacy. In accordance with our <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/privacy">privacy policy</a>, we never share any personal information with any of our partners, including Yahoo. To make that crystal clear, Yahoo itself published a <a href="https://help.yahoo.com/kb/search-for-desktop/SLN27299.html">privacy statement</a> to that effect. For more information, you can read about our <a href="https://duck.co/help/company/yahoo-partnership">partnership with Yahoo</a> and its <a href="https://duck.co/help/results/yahoo-technical-implementation">technical implementation</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Essentially, DuckDuckGo gets to control the core components of the integration, which should allow them maintain their previous privacy commitments. I&rsquo;m not sure if DuckDuckGo is the only service to get a deal like this, but their <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/traffic.html">335 million search queries last month</a> probably didn&rsquo;t hurt negotiations. If you read between the lines, Yahoo needed this more than DuckDuckGo did.</p>
