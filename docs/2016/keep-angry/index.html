  	<p>Leyla Acaroglu, in a piece for <em>Quartz</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our actions or inaction help determine the direction the world takes. If we quickly accept a new normalized state of being in order to avoid the discomfort of being frustrated or angry, we put ourselves in a dangerous position of inaction. If you let your mind say that everything will be okay, tune out, and coast back to a relaxed state of mind, no change is ever going to come of the world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the late Associate Justice William O. Douglas, who penned something similar:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As nightfall does not come all at once, neither does oppression. In both instances, there is a twilight when everything remains seemingly unchanged. And it is in such twilight that we all must be most aware of change in the air — however slight — lest we become unwitting victims of the darkness.</p>
