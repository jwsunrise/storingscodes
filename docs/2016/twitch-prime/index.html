<p>If you’re already an Amazon Prime subscriber, Twitch Prime membership is included at no extra cost. However, unlike the now-defunct Twitch Turbo, Twitch Prime is not being offered as a standalone upgrade; if you want Twitch Prime, you buy Amazon Prime. This differs from what Amazon has done with Audible, their audiobook arm, where an Audible subscription remains independent from any existing Amazon Prime membership.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>If you already have Amazon Prime, play video games, but have little interest in Twitch, there&rsquo;s one other reason you might consider signing up. Users who link their Twitch and Amazon accounts will receive discounts on new-release games sold through Amazon, for up to two weeks after launch. By preserving prelaunch discounts for two weeks, I hope more people avoid preordering and wait for the reviews to hit.</p>
