<blockquote>
<p>Delilah and Henry represent an emerging trend in games, of paired characters who are individually and collectively simpatico but who struggle with their own anxieties and with one another&rsquo;s perceived shortcomings. Their relationship has form and shape, though it shimmers and shifts as the story progresses.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>These two characters are written with a conviction and authenticity rarely seen in video games. Neither of them is idealized, not even for a second. Their self-doubts and flaws are carved into the script and into the optional responses. Their ordinariness is what makes them so appealing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The echoing refrain I&rsquo;ve heard about <em>Firewatch</em> is that it&rsquo;s very well written, and the voice acting is just great.</p>
