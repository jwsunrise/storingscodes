  	<p>Despite Argentina&rsquo;s unceremonious departure from this year&rsquo;s World Cup — following an <a href="https://mobile.nytimes.com/2018/06/21/sports/world-cup/argentina-vs-croatia-lionel-messi.html">embarrassing group stage performance</a> — their star player Lionel Messi is still a wonder to watch on the field — particularly when he doesn&rsquo;t have the ball. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/messi-walks-better-than-most-players-run/">Bobby Gardiner</a> for <em>FiveThirtyEight</em>:</p>

After an El Clasico match between Barcelona and Real Madrid in December 2017, there was <a href="https://www.sport-english.com/en/news/barca/how-barcas-lionel-messi-decided-the-clasico-in-walking-mode-6517548">widespread coverage</a> of the fact that Messi walked 83 percent of the roughly 5 miles he covered that game. Despite this, he scored and assisted in Barca&rsquo;s 3-0 trouncing. [&hellip;]</p>

<blockquote>
