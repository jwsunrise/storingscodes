<blockquote>
<p>Packaging can be annoying for any consumer (see: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrap_rage">wrap rage</a>). But for people with disabilities, it often creates yet another challenge in a world riddled with them, an unnecessary obstacle that leads to frustration and a delay getting to the object inside.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Recognizing that reality, Microsoft&rsquo;s Packaging Design team faced a unique challenge in creating a box for the new <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/stories/xbox-adaptive-controller/">Xbox Adaptive Controller</a>, designed to accommodate gamers with limited mobility. [&hellip;] It had to enable gamers with limited dexterity, who might be using just one hand or arm, to easily open the box and remove the controller. And it had to be as high-quality and aesthetically appealing as any other Xbox packaging.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I love everything about <a href="https://audacious.blog/2018/xbox-adaptive-controller/">this project</a>. The whole thing is a wonderful example of thoughtful design and innovative problem solving — and all for a group of gamers that are often overlooked.</p>
