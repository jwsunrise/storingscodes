  	<p>As usual with his hardware reviews, Mr. Ginter&rsquo;s written impressions are interspersed between some gorgeous product shots. On the HomePod itself, Mr. Ginter reaffirmed what most other reviewers noted (excellent speaker, okay digital assistant), but I like the way he put it here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>HomePod is a speaker. And a <em>really</em>, <em>really</em> good speaker at that. She plays music unlike any other device on Planet Earth, and her ground-breaking bass has ushered in new sounds to songs I&rsquo;ve heard since I was five years old. I&rsquo;ve listened to <a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/album/id1212477993?i=1212478105&amp;at=1l3v5At&amp;ct=tss&amp;app=itunes"><em>Streets</em></a> probably three or four times a week for the last five straight years and there are certain parts of Adam Clayton&rsquo;s bass guitar I didn&rsquo;t know existed until about a month ago.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The notion of discovering new music within your old music is wonderfully romantic and certainly something a high quality speaker can help with. But not all speakers look as good as HomePod or produce the same level of audio fidelity for the price. That&rsquo;s the selling point.</p>
<p>I have more thoughts on this HomePod-is-a-speaker-not-a-voice-assistant angle, but they ended up being long and rambly so I&rsquo;ve cut them from this piece. In general though, I think that we should review products by primarily measuring them against what they set out to accomplish, not by what the competition is doing. Mr. Ginter&rsquo;s review does that.</p>
