  	<p>Microsoft is exiting the browser engine market, and the next version of their Edge browser will be powered by Chromium; the Google-led open source web engine that powers Chrome. Ferdy Christant:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The web now runs on a single engine. There is not a single browser with a non-Chromium engine on mobile of any significance other than Safari. Which runs webkit, kind of the same engine as Chromium, which is based on webkit.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>On desktop, Edge’s departure from running their own engine, means there’s only one last man standing to counter the Chromium dominance: Firefox. Which is falling from a cliff, on its way to join the “everybody else” gang of insignificant browsers. With no serious way to truly counter it due to their near-absence on mobile, and their lack of control in pushing browser installs.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>So Chromium it is. If you’re now waiting for a message of hope or a happy ending, I have none.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Go read the whole piece, because it&rsquo;s a terrific overview of the current browser wars (if you can even still call it that) and the future of the open web.</p>
<p>I personally don&rsquo;t like using Chrome, but I&rsquo;m also on MacOS where Chrome isn&rsquo;t what I would call the best example of a Mac app. Still, with around 70% market share and the nearest competitor only holding about 10%, Chrome doesn&rsquo;t have to woo me to win.</p>
<p>And this is the crux of the issue. With Microsoft&rsquo;s exit, Apple is the only company left with both the money and browser engine to push back against Google&rsquo;s dominance. But as Mr. Christant points out, Safari&rsquo;s market share is largely due to the popularity of iOS, and the browser often lags behind the others when it comes to updates. Apple seems content with where Safari&rsquo;s at, because they don&rsquo;t face any browser engine competition on iOS where <em>all</em> browsers (Chrome, Firefox, etc.) have to use the WebKit (Safari) rendering engine.</p>
<p>Finally, as I <a href="https://audacious.blog/2017/advertisement-farm/">wrote last year</a>, &ldquo;Google controls the searches, the ads, and the window through which a majority of us see the internet.&rdquo; With Microsoft&rsquo;s adoption of Chromium, Google&rsquo;s influence over how a majority of the world sees the Internet will only grow.</p>
<p>To put it another way, consider this. Last quarter, Google&rsquo;s parent company Alphabet <a href="https://qz.com/1437760/alphabet-q3-earnings-googles-ad-growth-is-slowing/">made just under $29 billion from ad revenue</a>. Alphabet&rsquo;s advertising business is far and away where the company gets a majority its money. Now think of how this ad-driven, <a href="https://www.apnews.com/828aefab64d4411bac257a07c1af0ecb">privacy lax</a> company controls the world&rsquo;s most popular web browser with a near monopolistic amount of market share. Given that information, I find it hard to believe that Google will forever be an objective and faithful steward of what&rsquo;s best for the web, instead of what&rsquo;s best for Google—especially if their advertising chips are ever threatened. Thankfully, for us and for now, it seems like Google doesn&rsquo;t have too much to worry about in that regard.</p>
