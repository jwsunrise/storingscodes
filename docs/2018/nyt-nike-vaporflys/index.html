<p>If you like well designed charts and data, you&rsquo;ll like this report. <em>The Times</em> used public (user entered) data from social running app Strava to corroborate Nike&rsquo;s claim, and the results seemingly back up Nike&rsquo;s statements; runners who wore Vaporflys were consistently faster than runners who didn&rsquo;t.</p>
