  	<p>Google Inbox, the gesture-driven email experiment that turned your inbox into an actionable list of tasks, is going away at the end of March 2019. I get why they&rsquo;re shutting it down — Google wants to focus their efforts on Gmail, which recently <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2018/04/25/google-rolls-out-gmail-web-redesign/">received a brand new UI</a> — but I&rsquo;m still disappointed. Inbox made it easy to keep your, uh, inbox tidy  because the app grouped related types of messages; allowing you to send an entire category to the archive with a single swipe. I don&rsquo;t mind Mail on iOS, but Inbox always felt a bit faster for interfacing with Gmail, and Mail probably won&rsquo;t ever support Google&rsquo;s unique approach to labels-as-folders.</p>
