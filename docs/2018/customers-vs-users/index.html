  	<p>A lot of software isn&rsquo;t free. Plenty of people pay to use products. Yet, we call these people <em>users</em> in most of our copy and internal communications. Should we?</p>
<p>What if we tried calling them what they actually are: <em>customers</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>User story becomes customer story.</li>
<li>User review becomes customer review.</li>
<li>User issue becomes customer issue.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think the difference is important. Facebook has users. We have customers. By referring to your customers <em>as</em> customers, you&rsquo;re respecting the fact that someone is paying you for your work. We don&rsquo;t need to sell customer data—their hard-earned dollars keep us running. Also, a sentence like &ldquo;15 minutes of downtime&rdquo; hits harder when you know it&rsquo;s a customer on the other end.</p>
<p>You can argue that both paying and non-paying people are subsets of the generic <em>user</em>. And certainly, your company culture plays a larger role in whether you respect your customers (or users) than the terminology.</p>
<p>But I still think there&rsquo;s something here. Someone, somewhere is paying us for our products. That&rsquo;s a difference worth distinguishing.</p>
