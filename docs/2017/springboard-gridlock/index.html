  	<p>I <a href="https://audacious.blog/2016/iphone-7/">like my iPhone 7</a>, but big screens pose a reachability problem. Apple even has a mechanism within iOS called Reachability, where lightly tapping the home button twice slides the entire UI down, so the oft-on-top navigation elements are easier to hit. After several years of large iPhones, designers like Max Rudberg are starting to explore <a href="http://blog.maxrudberg.com/post/165590234593/ui-design-for-iphone-x-bottom-elements">moving key UI elements to the bottom of the screen</a>. This is good, because I like making common UI elements easier to reach, and I&rsquo;m pro- anything that stops me from tempting fate and gravity whenever I&rsquo;m trying to walk and tap the top-left of my iPhone&rsquo;s screen.</p>
<p>So why, as Apple continues to invest in large screens, is the current iOS Springboard still a forced top-to-bottom, left-to-right layout?</p>
<p>I want this:</p>

<p>Allowing me to put icons anywhere on the existing grid means I don&rsquo;t need to choose between a clean home screen and <a href="http://david-smith.org/blog/2014/10/15/blank-icon-slots/">hackery</a> to keep my most-used apps within reach. This isn&rsquo;t a new idea. For years, Android has both allowed an unrestricted grid layout and put default, non-docked icons near the bottom of the screen. I think it&rsquo;s served them well in the era of big phones.</p>
<p>Since its introduction 10 years ago, the iOS Springboard has been largely unchanged. We got folders in iOS 4, but not much since then. If we&rsquo;re to assume that the future is filled with 4.5–5.5 inch screens, I think affording users some flexibility in where their home screen icons go is worthy of consideration.</p>
<h2 id="and-now-some-common-questions-and-comments-i-hear-whenever-bringing-this-up-with-friends">And now, some common questions and comments I hear whenever bringing this up with friends</h2>
<p><em>Just use the Dock for your favorite apps.</em> — I routinely use more than four apps in a given day. iOS 11&rsquo;s <em>iPad</em> Dock almost solves this problem, but we&rsquo;re talking about phones here.</p>
<p><em>Springboard is restrictive, but it&rsquo;s behaves consistently, which is easier for new users to learn.</em> — Maybe, but I think whatever usability is lost would be regained quickly with a more flexible grid.</p>
<p><em>Whenever I see a screen with a top-to-bottom, left-to-right icon layout, my mind immediately thinks of iOS. Why would Apple ditch that free branding?</em> — Don&rsquo;t worry, I hear the iPhone X notch is super identifiable. That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ll all be using next year, right?</p>
<p><em>Reachability works well enough, and it&rsquo;s system-wide.</em> — Reachability isn&rsquo;t the answer, it&rsquo;s a band-aid to make our current navigation-on-the-top state less annoying.</p>
