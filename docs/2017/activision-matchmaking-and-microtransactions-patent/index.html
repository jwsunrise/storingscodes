  	<p><a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/glixel/news/how-activision-uses-matchmaking-tricks-to-sell-in-game-items-w509288">Brian Crecente</a>, <em>Glixel</em>, covering a devious-sounding patent application from 2015, which was recently granted to video game publisher Activision:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;For instance, the microtransaction engine may match a more expert/marquee player with a junior player to encourage the junior player to make game-related purchases of items possessed/used by the marquee player. A junior player may wish to emulate the marquee player by obtaining weapons or other items used by the marquee player.&rdquo; [&hellip;]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The system can also be much more specific in its analysis of potential customers in a game:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In a particular example, the junior player may wish to become an expert sniper in a game (e.g., as determined from the player profile),&rdquo; according to the patent. &ldquo;The microtransaction engine may match the junior player with a player that is a highly skilled sniper in the game. In this manner, the junior player may be encouraged to make game-related purchases such as a rifle or other item used by the marquee player. &quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As pointed out by Mr. Crecente, Activision states that the technology is not currently being used in any of their games. The company, which is one of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activision_Blizzard#Subsidiaries">many subsidiary video game publishers</a> to Activision Blizzard, contextualizes the patent as &ldquo;an exploratory patent filed in 2015 by an R&amp;D team working independently from our game studios&rdquo;. This, in case you need help parsing legalese, translates to, &ldquo;last year our parent company <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2017/02/09/activision-blizzard-more-than-doubled-the-money-it-earned-from-in-game-sales-in-2016/">made over $3.6 billion from in-game content</a>, and we really want to sell more&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Microtransactions are a cash cow, and although Activision Blizzard isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;currently&rdquo; employing any of the manipulative methods outlined in this patent, I don&rsquo;t have much faith it will stay that way for long, which is saddening.</p>
<p>For a long time, my copy of a video game was the same one everyone else had. It didn&rsquo;t matter if you were a kid down the street or the president of Activision Blizzard; we all got the same experience. However, the day where publishers make more money from in-game content than from the game itself is coming, and the only losers will be the players. When a better experience or higher odds of winning are tied to whether you&rsquo;re willing to outspend everyone else, video games start to lose their unifying appeal, which is why we started playing in the first place.</p>
