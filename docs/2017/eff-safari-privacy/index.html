<p>With the new <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/18/apple-stopping-ads-follow-you-around-internet-sabotage-advertising-industry-ios-11-and-macos-high-sierra-safari-internet">Safari 11 update</a>, Apple takes an important step to protect your privacy, specifically how your browsing habits are tracked and shared with parties other than the sites you visit. In response, Apple is <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/major-ad-trade-groups-release-joint-letter-outlining-deep-concerns-over-cookie-handling-functionality-of-apples-safari-11-browser-300519829.html">getting criticized by the advertising industry</a> for &ldquo;destroying the Internet&rsquo;s economic model.&rdquo; While the advertising industry is trying to shift the conversation to what they call the economic model of the Internet, the conversation must instead focus on the indiscriminate tracking of users and the violation of their privacy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How&rsquo;s this for an economic model: From anywhere in the world, at any time of day, on any device they own, you can market your products to a customer. Sounds like a pretty good deal, and I have to imagine the advertisers can make it work without going completely, ethically bankrupt.</p>
