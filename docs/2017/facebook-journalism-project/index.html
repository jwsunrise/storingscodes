  	<p>Fidji Simo, Director of Product at Facebook, recently announcing a large, coordinated effort to bolster Facebook&rsquo;s ability to collect, verify, and distribute online news. They&rsquo;re calling it the Facebook Journalism Project, and Mr. Simo categorized the various efforts of the project into three areas: collaborative development of news products, training and tools for journalists, and training and tools for everyone.</p>
<p>Predictably, a number of the efforts deal with helping journalists better understand and use Facebook products. This will come primarily through a whole new series of e-learning courses, eventually certified by <a href="http://www.poynter.org">Poynter</a>, that focus on Live, Instant Articles, and other Facebook tools for building a presence and distributing stories.</p>
<p>Of the 10 key areas Mr. Simo highlighted, three of them were particularly interesting: news-specific hackathons, focused on collaborating with news organizations; working with the <a href="http://www.thenewsliteracyproject.org/">News Literacy Project</a> to develop a series of public service ads for Facebook users; and helping First Draft News, a nonprofit focused on digital trust and ethics, establish a <a href="https://firstdraftnews.com/first-draft-prepares-big-year-ahead-support-40-new-partners/">virtual verification community</a> for eyewitness media. These are all problems that are both important and could benefit from a company with the influence and resources as Facebook.</p>
<p>Yet, for some, I imagine the Facebook Journalism Project serves as a visible reminder to how rough 2016 was for Facebook and online news.</p>
<p>In May, Gizmodo&rsquo;s Michael Nunez <a href="http://gizmodo.com/former-facebook-workers-we-routinely-suppressed-conser-1775461006">spoke with former Facebook workers</a>, who said they routinely suppressed conservative stories from appearing in the Trending Topics section of the site. This kicked off a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/05/09/former-facebook-staff-say-conservative-news-was-buried-raising-questions-about-its-political-influence/">whole</a> <a href="http://www.snopes.com/is-facebook-censoring-conservative-news/">slew</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/21/technology/facebook-trending-list-skewed-by-individual-judgment-not-institutional-bias.html">of</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10102830259184701">responses</a>, and set the stage for events later that summer.</p>
<p>In August, Facebook stated they had investigated the claims in Gizmodo&rsquo;s piece and <a href="http://newsroom.fb.com/news/2016/08/search-fyi-an-update-to-trending/">found &ldquo;no evidence of systematic bias&rdquo;</a>. Shortly after that story, Quartz reported that <a href="https://qz.com/768122/facebook-fires-human-editors-moves-to-algorithm-for-trending-topics/">Facebook had laid off the entire Trending Topics editorial staff</a> and would be replacing them with engineers, automation, and algorithms. Then, only three days after Quart&rsquo;z piece, the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2016/08/29/a-fake-headline-about-megyn-kelly-was-trending-on-facebook/">Washington Post reported</a> a top post for Facebook&rsquo;s Trending Topics featured a factually incorrect article about Megyn Kelly, stating she had been fired from Fox News. She hadn&rsquo;t, and attention shifted from the suppression of conservative news to the <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/craigsilverman/can-facebook-trending-fight-off-fake-news">unintentional elevation of fake stories</a>.</p>
<p>It goes on, and the 2016 election only served to raise Facebook&rsquo;s profile in the debate of <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/craigsilverman/partisan-fb-pages-analysis?utm_term=.qxD8azRKN#.cbEaXjeDm">fake news</a>, <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2016/11/11/501743684/zuckerberg-denies-fake-news-on-facebook-had-impact-on-the-election">responsibility</a>, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/14/technology/facebook-is-said-to-question-its-influence-in-election.html">influence</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>In some ways, the Facebook Journalism Project is embarrassingly late to the party, and work to tackle the effects of <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2016/11/the_problem_with_facebook_runs_much_deeper_than_fake_news.html">reinforced ideological bubbles</a> could have begun much sooner. In 2016, the Pew Research Center reported that <a href="http://www.journalism.org/2016/05/26/news-use-across-social-media-platforms-2016/">62% of U.S. adults get their news from social media</a>, and on Facebook, which reaches about 67% of all U.S. adults, about two-thirds of its users get their news from the site. I imagine those numbers will continue to rise for the foreseeable future, as Facebook looks to <a href="http://newsroom.fb.com/company-info/">push past over 1.8 billion active monthly users</a>.</p>
<p>The Facebook Journalism Project is a good <em>first</em> set of acknowledgements and initiatives, but they shouldn&rsquo;t be the only ones. If Facebook wants to be a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/21/fbonc/">&ldquo;place for public discourse&rdquo;</a>, an institution that blends media and technology, the company should continue to devote money, talent, and time to projects like this one. The first step to solving a problem is recognizing there is one, and while I don&rsquo;t know if the Facebook Journalism Project will solve anything, it&rsquo;s uplifting that they&rsquo;re trying.</p>
