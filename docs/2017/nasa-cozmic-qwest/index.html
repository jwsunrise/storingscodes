  	<p><em>The Verge&rsquo;s</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/11/16454684/nasa-video-game-cosmic-quest-errors-kennedy-center">Brian Patrick Byrne</a> with a bizarre story on <em>Cosmic Quest</em>, a video game in NASA’s Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Cosmic Quest</em>, developed by a gaming company called Creative Kingdoms, officially opened at the visitor complex in March 2016. The game costs $19.95, and allows players to “launch a rocket, redirect an asteroid, build a Martian habitat, and perform scientific experiments aboard the International Space Station.” But it doesn’t seem to have been properly vetted. [&hellip;]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The Verge</em> also discovered several typos in the game. For instance, in a bit about experiments with Martian surface chemicals, the game renders “analyze” as “analys.” The game discusses “basic chemistry principals” — should be “principles” — and says: “Now you will understand … why are research is so important.” The game spells “oxide” as “oxcide,” and, perhaps more forgivably, mistakes the verb “affect” for the noun “effect.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Regardless whether Creative Kingdoms or Delaware North (operator of Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex) is ultimately responsible for <em>Cosmic Quest</em>, the fact a scientifically inaccurate space game—aimed at kids—was in NASA&rsquo;s house is an embarrassment.</p>
