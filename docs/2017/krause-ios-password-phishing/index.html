  	<p>Everyone&rsquo;s seen the &ldquo;Sign In to iTunes Store&rdquo; dialog, where we&rsquo;re asked to enter our passwords to confirm purchases or view certain iCloud settings. The problem, as <a href="https://krausefx.com/blog/ios-privacy-stealpassword-easily-get-the-users-apple-id-password-just-by-asking">pointed out by Felix Krause</a>, is that the system dialog UI is available to all app developers, meaning a malicious app could present a fake password prompt. Considering how conditioned we are to quickly fill out and submit these dialogs, this particular phishing attack is potent.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there&rsquo;s no way to visually distinguish an official dialog from a phishing dialog, as the two look identical. However, Mr. Krause points out that by hitting the home button, a phishing dialog will close along with its app, but a system dialog will remain visible until canceled. Meanwhile, our best protection—for the masses, at least—is Apple&rsquo;s App Store review team denying or pulling apps that try this crap.</p>
