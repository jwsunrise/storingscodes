  	<p>Up between 6–6:30. Drink a full glass of water, take a shower, get dressed. Make the bed; <a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-make-a-bed-using-hospital-corners/">hospital corners</a>. Put on tennis shoes. I tried slippers for a while, but a standing desk calls for extra arch support.</p>
<p>Downstairs, start the coffee. 50 grams for about 6 cups. It&rsquo;s a weaker brew, but that means I can have a few cups without getting twitchy. Water into the stovetop pot. Add oats. Make breakfast. (How have more people not experienced the awesomeness of oats, greek yogurt, and a little brown sugar?)</p>
<p>Family time, morning talks, good vibes. It&rsquo;s about 8:00. Another 10-15 minutes, then I’ll grab a large cup of coffee and head upstairs to the office.</p>
<p>Crack the windows, let sunshine stream in.</p>
<p>8:15-45 is my chance to parse the day. I start with a beat of silence and a prayer, then I take a large sip of coffee and flick open a variety of windows.</p>
<p>First up, Slack and email.</p>
<p>90% of my Slack channels are muted. My notifications are off by default, which helps me treat Slack more like email and less like a 90s pager. I scan all unread channels and DMs, then throw anything warranting a followup into Starred.</p>
<p>Email is next. Through years of filter creation, my email is sort of like the Millenium Falcon—filled with really old stuff but tuned <em>exactly</em> how I like it. Everything in my inbox is signal.</p>
<p>Within several minutes, Slack and email are completely dispatched. Now to the calendar. What am I attending today? Tomorrow? What information do I need to have ready? Look at a handful of dashboards. How’s the bug count this week? Which teams have key members on PTO? Did the last 24 hours of pulse metrics look like I expected?</p>
<p>Close the windows, because the sun is doing its thing and warming up the Earth.</p>
<p>Visually, my calendar is stuffed. But a third of those chunky boxes are meetings with myself. Margin time, at least 1-2 hours every single day. It’s here that I work on my Most Important Things.</p>
<p>What are the Most Important Things? I have a simple system: take the top 2-4 most important things I could do this week and put them on a flashcard. The rest of the day will be about relentlessly attempting to complete everything on this list. I&rsquo;ll usually get through about half, while adding 5-10 new items along the way. Tomorrow I’ll prune it back down to the top 2-4. Rinse, wash, repeat.</p>
<p>(What about a to-do app? I use one, but I use it differently than most. The only things that go in here are commitments I’ve made to other people. My to-do app is my your-word-means-something app.)</p>
<p>Pop downstairs, grab some snuggles from the kiddo, refill the coffee, and climb back upstairs.</p>
<p>The rest of the day oscillates between meetings and my Most Important Things. For meetings, I have a yellow legal pad and a .5mm rollerball. I used to roll with a .38mm, but the .5 feels way more messy and therefore better. Once the day is wrapped, I go back through every page of notes and move things either into my to-do app or onto my calendar. I&rsquo;ve considered an iPad for this daylong writing, but I like paper. Again, the mess is what makes it great.</p>
<p>Finally, I journal for 5-10 minutes. This is some of the most important writing I do each day. I focus on any decisions I made and my rationale for making them.</p>
<p>Downstairs, dinner, books, bed, and hope to be just a little bit better tomorrow.</p>
