		Kev Quirk thinks having a non-truncated RSS feed is a good idea. I agree. So does Zac Szewczyk:
 Whenever I find a new writer, I go through everything they have ever written — turns out, good writers write good things often; this helps me find great works from their past. RSS feeds with, say, the site’s ten most recent posts make this much harder than ones with every article in them, so when I restarted this site, I took the latter route.

		Nick Stat, The Verge:
 Google has officially removed the Hangouts brand from its enterprise G Suite offering with the rebranding of Hangouts Chat as Google Chat, the company confirmed to The Verge on Thursday. The rebranding follows a similar name change, confirmed yesterday, from the companion videoconferencing app Hangouts Meet to Google Meet.
  This latest modification was first hinted at by an updated G Suite support document listing the Google Chat name alongside Google Meet.

		A wonderful writeup from one of my favorite editors. I particularly enjoyed this bit on the craft:
 This year was transformative for me as far as my writing skills are concerned. I got to the point where I can now sit down and knock out 3000-5000 good words in one sitting, even when completely exhausted at the end of a long workday. My day job as an editor made all the difference here: since I’m so used to thinking of writing and editing as work, I no longer get writer’s block and writing has lost most of its mythical quality (which is a good thing, as far as I’m concerned).

		If I could only teach my non-technical friends two things about technology, I would encourage them to (a) learn the keyboard shortcuts for their most-used apps and (b) use RSS to read the news.
Speaking of RSS, Brent Simmons has finally finished rewriting NetNewsWire—the storied RSS reader for the Mac. You can pick it up for free, and even if you&rsquo;re not sure what RSS is, check out the link because, again, it&rsquo;s one of only two things I wish more people knew about.

		Katie Notopoulos, Buzzfeed:
 Let’s call this “boss email.” It’s defined by nearly immediate — but short and terse — replies. The classic two-word email.
 I used to have a &ldquo;Sent from my iPhone&rdquo; signature, regardless of whether I was on my phone or laptop. Helped to keep things terse.

 “Over the last two years, we’ve shown Google irrefutable evidence again and again that they are displaying lyrics copied from Genius,” said Ben Gross, Genius’s chief strategy officer, in an email message. The company said it used a watermarking system in its lyrics that embedded patterns in the formatting of apostrophes. Genius said it found more than 100 examples of songs on Google that came from its site.

		Maciej Cegłowski:
 Practical campaign security is a wood chipper for your hopes and dreams. It sits at the intersection of 19 kinds of status quo, each more odious than the last. You have to accept the fact that computers are broken, software is terrible, campaign finance is evil, the political parties are inept, the DCCC exists, politics is full of parasites, tech companies are run by arrogant man-children, and so on.

		From Panic&rsquo;s press release:
 Today, after more than four years of work by a small and talented team, Panic is extremely excited to introduce Playdate, a brand new handheld gaming system.
  Playdate is both very familiar, and totally new. It’s yellow, and fits perfectly in a pocket. It has a black-and-white screen with high reflectivity, a crystal-clear image, and no backlight. And of course, it has Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, USB-C, and a headphone jack.

		Geoffrey A. Fowler, Washington Post:
 I listened to four years of my Alexa archive and found thousands of fragments of my life: spaghetti-timer requests, joking houseguests and random snippets of “Downton Abbey.” There were even sensitive conversations that somehow triggered Alexa’s “wake word” to start recording, including my family discussing medication and a friend conducting a business deal.

		Pierre Valade (previously CEO of Sunrise Calendar, which was acquired by Microsoft) has launched Jumbo, a &ldquo;privacy assistant&rdquo; for iOS. Curious, I thought, because most other digital assistants are hellbent on collecting as much information about me as possible. In reality, Jumbo is less of an assistant and more of a user-friendly way for you to delete old tweets, Alexa voice recordings, and Google searches. One tap and everything gets erased.

		Typographer, writer, and lawyer Matthew Butterick:
 For those who think it trivializes our political process to judge candidates by their typography—what would you prefer we scrutinize? Qualifications? Ground into dust during the last election. Issues? Be my guest. Whether a candidate will ever fulfill a certain campaign promise about a certain issue is conjectural.
  But typography—that’s a real decision candidates have to make today, with real money and real consequences.

		Between art historian Andrew Tallon&rsquo;s laser scanning of the entire cathedral in 2015 and the incredibly detailed models created for Ubisoft&rsquo;s mega-franchise Assassin&rsquo;s Creed: Unity, the French people have not only centimeter-level measurements, but also an entire interactive, atmospheric representation of Notre-Dame to reference as they rebuild.
 I had the luck to visit Notre-Dame several years ago, and it was simply awe inspiring. To see it in flames last week evoked what can only be described as a deep sense of mourning.

		<h2><a title="Medium, Seven Years Later" href="https://audacious.blog/2019/butterick-on-mediums-history/">Medium, Seven Years Later</a></h2>
		Matthew Butterick, with some additional analysis on Laura Owen&rsquo;s deep dive into Medium&rsquo;s history:
 What stands out the most? Though Medium’s value to online publishing has remained abstract, the harm it has inflicted—especially upon the authors and publications who have been lured onto the platform (by one pivot) and then stranded (by the next)—is concrete. As writer Jaya Saxena put it, “every writer/cartoonist I know has had their life ruined by Medium at some point”.

		I&rsquo;ve secretly been wishing for someone to create a complete compendium of Medium&rsquo;s trials and tribulations because the task, had I taken it on myself, would have simply driven me into a deep, dark, depressing place from which I may not have emerged. Thankfully Laura Hazard Owen, writing for the Nieman Journalism Lab, was more than up to the task:

 Letter Boxed takes place around, well, a box. There are three letters on each side, and players must connect them to make words at least three letters long. Letters on the same side cannot be used consecutively, and the final letter of each word becomes the first letter of the next word.

 Let&rsquo;s get this out of the way. I&rsquo;m supposed to say that my greatest source of pride is my children, but they haven&rsquo;t really done anything that special.

Good on them for pushing this out to everyone—I&rsquo;ve found it to be significantly faster and nicer to use than the normal site. It&rsquo;s also (sadly) the best official way to use Twitter on your Mac.
If you&rsquo;re still seeing the old/current version, you can check out what&rsquo;s coming by going directly to mobile.

 [&hellip;] Netflix estimated that it commands 10 percent of television screen time in the U.S., and slightly less than that for total mobile screen time. In other countries, the percentages are lower due to &ldquo;lower penetration of our service.&rdquo; The reason, Netflix said, isn&rsquo;t because of obvious streaming competition, but of online platforms and video games.
  &ldquo;We compete with (and lose to) Fortnite more than HBO,&rdquo; the report indicated.

 These days Medium is focused on their membership offering, though. Trying to aggregate writing from many sources and sell a broad subscription on top of that. And it’s a neat model, and it’s wonderful to see Medium try something different. But it’s not for us, and it’s not for Signal v Noise.

  Previously, the only way to connect a security key to an iPhone was over Bluetooth, which suffered Bluetooth’s normal usability issues as well as potential security concerns around mistaken pairings.

		<h2><a title="GitHub Now Allows Free Accounts to Have Unlimited Private Repositories" href="https://audacious.blog/2019/github-unlimited-private-repos/">GitHub Now Allows Free Accounts to Have Unlimited Private Repositories</a></h2>
		I&rsquo;ve recommended the code sharing/developer social network GitHub to many people (students and writers primarily), but the recommendation always came with the giant asterisk that everything you published would be public. It&rsquo;s nice that&rsquo;s no longer the case. GitHub becomes a far more attractive service—and stronger social network—when you can host all your work there.
This also makes a lot of sense for where Microsoft might want to take GitHub. The majority of GitHub&rsquo;s future revenue is likely to come in the form of lucrative Enterprise accounts at large companies—something Microsoft is well positioned to push—rather than free (née personal) accounts that upgrade to paid tiers.

		Tom Warren, The Verge, on the news that not only is Microsoft rebuilding Edge on Chromium, but they&rsquo;re also bringing it to the Mac:
 A lot of web developers use a Mac to develop and test sites, but Edge doesn’t exist there, and it’s currently difficult to test Microsoft’s web rendering engine on a Mac without dual booting Windows. Microsoft is now bringing Edge to the Mac. We understand it’s not a move designed to grab more market share specifically; it’s more about making it easier for developers to test Edge.

 The web now runs on a single engine. There is not a single browser with a non-Chromium engine on mobile of any significance other than Safari. Which runs webkit, kind of the same engine as Chromium, which is based on webkit.

The latest update makes Marvin Visions available as a variable font, which means you have granular control over both weight and optical size without a dramatic increase in file size. There&rsquo;s a two-dimensional slider about a quarter of the way down the page if you want to see what I mean.

		Companies that aren&rsquo;t tracking towards profitability either die or raise more cash—that&rsquo;s obvious and not why I&rsquo;m linking to this story. What makes this piece by Jim Edwards, Business Insider, interesting are the readership stats and hint towards future product direction for Medium:
 The site currently has 90 million unique users each month, and publishes 20,000 articles per day, mostly from writers creating one-off articles. It recently moved away from selling advertising as a revenue model to a subscription paywall, in which readers are asked for money if they see more than three stories per month.

		Nick Statt, The Verge:
 Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales&rsquo; digital media company, the WikiTribune, is shifting its focus away from traditional news-gathering and moving to a &ldquo;community oriented&rdquo; strategy that prioritizes working with contributors.   In the process, the company has laid off its 12 original editorial staffers, reports The Drum, following the April departure of CNN and Reuters journalist Peter Bale, who initially assembled the team. The WikiTribune began in August of last year, and Wales and his co-founder Orit Kopel posted a note to the site earlier this week first mentioning the &ldquo;major personnel changes&rdquo; and the reframing of its focus on the community.

		Earlier this month, Google announced their intentions to publicly test a video game streaming technology called Project Stream. Beta testers would have the opportunity to stream Ubisoft&rsquo;s latest blockbuster Assassin&rsquo;s Creed in Google Chrome, so long as they had a 25 Mbps Internet connection and relatively low ping.
A week later, several outlets have had the chance to test Project Stream, and the results are positive:

		Jacob Kastrenakes, The Verge:
 In the past, Wi-Fi versions were identified by a letter or a pair of letters that referred to a wireless standard. The current version is 802.11ac, but before that, we had 802.11n, 802.11g, 802.11a, and 802.11b. It was not comprehensible, so the Wi-Fi Alliance — the group that stewards the implementation of Wi-Fi — is changing it.

But according to Valve&rsquo;s own statistics, almost half of their supposed 125 million Steam accounts have connected some form of an external controller. What does this tell us? Nothing particularly interesting, except that the Xbox&rsquo;s majority share reaffirms my belief that Microsoft makes some of the best console controllers on the market.

 A sentence is much more than its literal meaning. It is a living line of words where logic and lyric meet &ndash; a piece of both sense and sound, albeit the sound is only heard in the reader&rsquo;s head. Rookie sentence-writers are often too busy worrying about the something they are trying to say and don&rsquo;t worry enough about how that something looks and sounds.

		According to Dunbar&rsquo;s Number, &ldquo;humans can comfortably maintain only 150 stable relationships.&rdquo; Path, at its core, was a social network built around this idea. When the service launched, you could only have 50 friends. They later expanded that number to 150 (and then 500), but in those early years the network limitation forced you to only connect with people who really mattered to you. No old high school acquaintances, no business fan pages.

 Telltale Games, creators of episodic adventure games like The Walking Dead, The Wolf Among Us, and Batman: The Enemy Within, laid off a large number of its staff today. The company will retain a small team of 25. According to multiple sources The Verge spoke with, employees were let go with no severance.
  &ldquo;Today Telltale Games made the difficult decision to begin a majority studio closure following a year marked by insurmountable challenges,&rdquo; the company said in a statement.

		When you perform a right-click in MacOS via the trackpad — by clicking or tapping with two fingers — there&rsquo;s a small delay before you see the contextual menu appear. Apparently, to my delight, this lag can be removed by disabling the &ldquo;Smart zoom&rdquo; gesture, relieving MacOS from waiting a few milliseconds to see if another two-finger tap/click was on the way, which would indicate you wanted to zoom the current content.

I get why they&rsquo;re shutting it down — Google wants to focus their efforts on Gmail, which recently received a brand new UI — but I&rsquo;m still disappointed. Inbox made it easy to keep your, uh, inbox tidy because the app grouped related types of messages; allowing you to send an entire category to the archive with a single swipe.

		<h2><a title="Universities Create New Courses to Address the Ethics of Technology" href="https://audacious.blog/2018/computer-science-ethics/">Universities Create New Courses to Address the Ethics of Technology</a></h2>
		Natasha Singer, New York Times:
 The courses are emerging at a moment when big tech companies have been struggling to handle the side effects — fake news on Facebook, fake followers on Twitter, lewd children’s videos on YouTube — of the industry’s build-it-first mind-set. They amount to an open challenge to a common Silicon Valley attitude that has generally dismissed ethics as a hindrance.
  “We need to at least teach people that there’s a dark side to the idea that you should move fast and break things,” said Laura Norén, a postdoctoral fellow at the Center for Data Science at New York University who began teaching a new data science ethics course this semester.

		Angela Guzman, retelling the story of her 2008 summer in Cupertino, where she and fellow designer Raymond created several hundred of Apple&rsquo;s original emojis:
 My first emoji was the engagement ring, and I chose it because it had challenging textures like metal and a faceted gem, tricky to render for a beginner. The metal ring alone took me an entire day. Pretty soon, however, I could do two a day, then three, and so forth.

		Marissa Grunes, The Paris Review:
 Primitive Technology was created two years ago by a man in Queensland, Australia, who builds huts, weapons, and tools using only naturally occurring materials. In all of his five- to ten-minute videos, the man wears only navy blue shorts, rarely looks at the camera, and never speaks.
  It’s a niche concept, to be sure. The channel does not focus on historically accurate building techniques.

In short, it&rsquo;s a staggering amount of personal data, anonymized and aggregated, and overlaid on a map.
For two months, the report made little fanfare.

		Founder of Baremetrics, Josh Pigford:
 I realized Medium is really great about surfacing content, but it removes the face of it. It neutralizes all content to basically be author-agnostic. It’s like Walmart or Amazon in that you can buy from thousands of different brands, but you rarely actually know what brand you’re buying…you just know “I got it from Amazon.”
  Same with content on Medium. Sure, you can see who the author is or what publication it’s on, but ultimately your takeaway is “I read this article on Medium”, and that’s not what I wanted.

A practical, real example for why you should start your interface designs by focusing on the words.
Aside: Although the correction took too long to get out, I thought the message on Hawaii&rsquo;s digital highway signs, &ldquo;missile alert / in error / there is no threat&rdquo; was particularly terse and efficient.

		Adam O’Fallon Price:
 Periods, commas, colons, semi-colons: in their use or non-use and in their order and placement, can represent elaboration, conjecture, doubt, finality. And in aggregate, over the course of a text, the rhythms of punctuation advance an author’s worldview and personality as surely as any plot or theme. Patterns of punctuation usage are the writerly equivalent of an athlete’s go-to moves, or a singer’s peculiar timbre and range—those little dots and squiggles, in a sense, encode your voice.

Personally, I find the visual a far more clear example of what the Firefox UI copy should read like than a bullet list of examples would have conveyed. I also appreciate how a range implies flexibility for the writer to approach the language from a few different angles. A good reminder that product design writing isn&rsquo;t about how it&rsquo;s written, it&rsquo;s about how it reads.

		Apple PR:
 To mitigate Dubai’s climate, Foster + Partners designed eighteen 37.5-foot-high motorized “Solar Wings” that respond to the ever-changing environmental conditions. When the sun is at its hottest they cool the store, and in the evenings they open to welcome everyone to the public terrace. Inspired by the the traditional Arabic Mashrabiya, each “Solar Wing” is locally fabricated from 340 carbon fiber reinforced polymer rods, and at 180 feet wide, the 18 panels make up one of the world’s largest kinetic art installations.

The device’s app ships with software called “Style Check,” which Amazon describes as “a new service that combines machine learning algorithms with advice from fashion specialists,” that lets users compare two photos taken through the Look to decide which outfit is better.

 Instead of saying “people who,” Donald Trump said “people that.” Marco Rubio followed suit. Even Jeb Bush, putatively the brainy one, was “that”-ing when he should have been “who”-ing, so I was cringing when I should have been oohing.
  It’s always a dangerous thing when politicians get near the English language: Run for the exits and cover the children’s ears.

According to Nintendo, this makes the Nintendo Switch and Breath of the Wild two of the fastest selling systems and games of all time.

 Thus we propose perceptual ad blocking which works radically differently from current ad blockers. It deliberately ignores useful information in markup and limits itself to visually salient information, mimicking how a human user would recognize ads. We use lightweight computer vision techniques to implement such a tool and show that it defeats attempts to obfuscate the presence of ads.

 On the one side, there&rsquo;s the built-in story of the game, which is just terrible. At worst, it is incomprehensible spacey-spaceman gibberish about ancient civilizations and lost artifacts. And at it&rsquo;s best, it ain&rsquo;t much better — failing on many basic levels to tell a meta-story about the in-game universe being a simulation (which, you know, it is) where the player (also called &ldquo;the Traveler&rdquo;) is tasked by its creator to explore his way to the center of everything, essentially making the player a kind of galactic-level landlord checking in on all the tenants.

		<h2><a title="NPR.org Ditches Comments" href="https://audacious.blog/2016/npr-comments/">NPR.org Ditches Comments</a></h2>
		Elizabeth Jenson, NPR:
 More than half of all comments in May, June and July combined came from a mere 2,600 users. The conclusion: NPR&rsquo;s commenting system — which gets more expensive the more comments that are posted, and in some months has cost NPR twice what was budgeted — is serving a very, very small slice of its overall audience. [&hellip;]
  Other organizations such as The New York Times manage to keep their comments relatively civil.

		Sydney Ember, reporting for the New York Times, on the shuttering of NYT Now:
 But the app never quite took off as The Times had hoped, and last year, it transitioned from subscription to free in the hopes that the new model might give The Times more of an opportunity to expand its audience. [..]
  At its peak, in May 2015, NYT Now had 334,000 total unique users.

		Speaking of apps that are going away, next up is Vesper, an iOS note taking app from Q Branch. Reading through the release notes, it seems Q Branch itself — comprised of well-known writer John Gruber, developer Brent Simmons, and designer Dave Wiskus — will also be shutting down within the next month.
I stopped using Vesper about a year ago, but it was a well-designed little app. I really dug the typography, and it&rsquo;s syncing engine was fast and superbly thought out.

		This year&rsquo;s Ookla Speedtest Market Report:
 The data from the first six months of 2016 is in; the internet in the United States has gotten faster. Fixed broadband customers have seen the biggest jump in performance with download speeds achieving an average of over 50 Mbps for the first time ever. This improvement is more than a 40% increase since July 2015.
 Any progress is good news, particularly for the U.

		<h2><a title="Pro Evolution Soccer Looks to Steal FIFA’s Crown" href="https://audacious.blog/2016/pes-vs-fifa/">Pro Evolution Soccer Looks to Steal FIFA’s Crown</a></h2>
		Sean Clever, GameSpot:
 With the FIFA series moving to a new engine, EA&rsquo;s franchise is in a transitional year. This means PES has the first chance since its PS2 heyday to become the most popular football game. The decision not mess with what works means PES 2017 has a strong foundation, and the new minor adjustments look to be strengthening it. This could be the year.
 Maybe, but I doubt it.

		New design, better connectivity, built-in Bluetooth. Looks nice. For an extra $20, you can order a color-customized version, but the default colors look perfectly acceptable to my eyes.
The original Xbox One may have been an ugly black box, but Microsoft&rsquo;s controller designs have repeatedly outdistanced Sony&rsquo;s own attempts. This latest iteration continues the trend.

		Contextual, in-depth look at the URL and its failed alternatives. Zack Bloom, writing for the Eager company blog:
 In the world of web applications, it can be a little odd to think of the basis for the web being the hyperlink. It is a method of linking one document to another, which was gradually augmented with styling, code execution, sessions, authentication, and ultimately became the social shared computing experience so many 70s researchers were trying (and failing) to create.

		Nick Bilton, for Vanity Fair:
 It doesn’t take a political scientist to see that the world is on edge. And technology, we often forget, undergirds this political reality. The Internet and innovation have made cultures around the globe collide with historically unprecedented force. With the exception of perhaps a handful of rogue states, like North Korea, we all now eat at the same McDonald’s, use the same iPhones and discuss the same hot-button topics on the same social networks.

		DuckDuckGo, the privacy-focused search engine, just announced a new partnership with Yahoo. This partnership isn&rsquo;t necessarily new, perhaps more renewed, as DuckDuckGo has utilized Yahoo&rsquo;s BOSS (Build Your Own Search Service) API for years. That said, I wasn&rsquo;t sure what DuckDuckGo was going to do when Yahoo announced it was discontinuing the BOSS API earlier this year.
Now we know.
DuckDuckGo will continue to get results, and a few extra features like date filtering on results, from Yahoo by way of a custom integrations between each service.

		A year ago, Facebook announced a new News Feed that was completely redesigned to focus on content–it had large photos, big user icons, better integration with Facebook messenger, and it brought Facebook’s website into closer alignment with its mobile apps. It was beautiful. During the few months I was able to use the new design, my Facebook experience was significantly better. Here’s what it looked like:

 To create Piper, Barillaro and his entire team entered the Sanderlings’ world. They spent weekends on beaches all over the Bay Area, meeting at 5 a.m. on a dusty road under a bridge in search of the birds. “Half of us were chasing around different beaches and calling each other on cell phones until we found a flock we could get close to,” Barillaro says.

 That&rsquo;s Shigeru Miyamoto at Nintendo&rsquo;s latest shareholders meeting, reported on by Lucy O&rsquo;Brien, for IGN.
 With this said, Miyamoto does not hesitate to call Zelda&rsquo;s new world &ldquo;vast.

 As we want the open web to remain strong, we were delighted to find that the folks at Medium share the same values. And we think that Superfeedr&rsquo;s acquisition is a powerful indicator of Medium&rsquo;s support for open protocols. As an example of this, my first commit at Medium was to enable full content RSS feeds both for publications and users (available in your settings).

 In truth, Medium’s main prod­uct is not a pub­lish­ing plat­form, but the pro­mo­tion of a pub­lish­ing plat­form. This pro­mo­tion brings read­ers and writ­ers onto the site.

		I&rsquo;ve been looking forward to this game for two years, and it&rsquo;s almost here. I&rsquo;ll be covering the reviews that get released today, but I&rsquo;ll omit anything from my commentary or the pull-quotes that might spoil unreleased details about the game.
For the unaware, Firewatch is the first game from Panic-backed game studio, Campo Santo. Aside from the art style, which looks incredible, I&rsquo;m most excited to work my way through the story.

		John Walker, writing for Rock Paper Shotgun:
 At a certain point you find a disposable cardboard camera with most of its film still available, and are encouraged by Delilah to take some snaps of anything you find interesting. And it’s worth doing so, because as well as a nice little surprise toward the end, once you’ve filled your film a menu option becomes available to have them processed and delivered to your real-world house as glossy photographs.

Letterpress, which got updated to version 1.6 today, now lists Solebon LLC as the seller, and the official Letterpress website has been updated to reflect this change in ownership:

		Last one for the night. Hayden Dingman, covering the game for PCWorld:
 Firewatch is beautiful. Firewatch is intriguing. But ultimately I don&rsquo;t think Firewatch is very good. At its best, this is a quiet game about two characters struggling with real-life insecurities. But when that&rsquo;s sidelined to make room for a main plot, Firewatch suffers. It&rsquo;s a game perfect for trailers, a game full of excellent dialogue and breathtaking moments and stunning vistas that ultimately amounts to nothing much at all.

		Colin Campbell, reporting for Polygon:
 Delilah and Henry represent an emerging trend in games, of paired characters who are individually and collectively simpatico but who struggle with their own anxieties and with one another&rsquo;s perceived shortcomings. Their relationship has form and shape, though it shimmers and shifts as the story progresses.
  These two characters are written with a conviction and authenticity rarely seen in video games. Neither of them is idealized, not even for a second.

The Guardian&rsquo;s Nathan Ditum, in his review of Firewatch:
 The writing is not just believable, it is likeable and funny. Henry and Delilah’s exchanges are full of the familiar tug and tarry of people getting to know each other, of playing and of flirting, and of reaching out to feel less alone.

My Kindle is one of few devices where I can consume media without distraction.

Rather, Google has developed a Go-playing AI that went 5-0 against reigning 3-time European champion, Fan Hui. Google’s David Silver and Demis Hassabis, writing for the Google Research Blog:
 We first trained the policy network on 30 million moves from games played by human experts, until it could predict the human move 57% of the time (the previous record before AlphaGo was 44%).

As I read, and reread, my way through Harry Potter, I remember Snape&rsquo;s dialogue taking on Rickman&rsquo;s permeating, apathetic tone. For me, Rickman made the books better.
Many people will remember Rickman for his role in Die Hard or his stage performances, but I, and I suspect many of my peers, will remember him as one of the &ldquo;best damn antagonists&rdquo; our generation could ask for.

 If partnering with Facebook meant that we had to change our values, we wouldn&rsquo;t have done it. Instead, we are forming a partnership that would allow us to continue operating independently and autonomously. Our fundamental values and beliefs will not change. Our principles will not change. Everything that has made WhatsApp the leader in personal messaging will still be in place.
