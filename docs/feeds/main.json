Make the bed; \u003ca href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-make-a-bed-using-hospital-corners/\"\u003ehospital corners\u003c/a\u003e. Put on tennis shoes. I tried slippers for a while, but a standing desk calls for extra arch support.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDownstairs, start the coffee. 50 grams for about 6 cups. It\u0026rsquo;s a weaker brew, but that means I can have a few cups without getting twitchy. Water into the stovetop pot. Add oats. Make breakfast. (How have more people not experienced the awesomeness of oats, greek yogurt, and a little brown sugar?)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFamily time, morning talks, good vibes. It\u0026rsquo;s about 8:00. Another 10-15 minutes, then I’ll grab a large cup of coffee and head upstairs to the office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrack the windows, let sunshine stream in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e8:15-45 is my chance to parse the day. I start with a beat of silence and a prayer, then I take a large sip of coffee and flick open a variety of windows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst up, Slack and email.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e90% of my Slack channels are muted. My notifications are off by default, which helps me treat Slack more like email and less like a 90s pager. I scan all unread channels and DMs, then throw anything warranting a followup into Starred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmail is next. Through years of filter creation, my email is sort of like the Millenium Falcon—filled with really old stuff but tuned \u003cem\u003eexactly\u003c/em\u003e how I like it. Everything in my inbox is signal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin several minutes, Slack and email are completely dispatched. Now to the calendar. What am I attending today? Tomorrow? What information do I need to have ready? Look at a handful of dashboards. How’s the bug count this week? Which teams have key members on PTO? Did the last 24 hours of pulse metrics look like I expected?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClose the windows, because the sun is doing its thing and warming up the Earth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVisually, my calendar is stuffed. But a third of those chunky boxes are meetings with myself. Margin time, at least 1-2 hours every single day. It’s here that I work on my Most Important Things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat are the Most Important Things? I have a simple system: take the top 2-4 most important things I could do this week and put them on a flashcard. The rest of the day will be about relentlessly attempting to complete everything on this list. I\u0026rsquo;ll usually get through about half, while adding 5-10 new items along the way. Tomorrow I’ll prune it back down to the top 2-4. Rinse, wash, repeat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(What about a to-do app? I use one, but I use it differently than most. The only things that go in here are commitments I’ve made to other people. My to-do app is my your-word-means-something app.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePop downstairs, grab some snuggles from the kiddo, refill the coffee, and climb back upstairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rest of the day oscillates between meetings and my Most Important Things. For meetings, I have a yellow legal pad and a .5mm rollerball. I used to roll with a .38mm, but the .5 feels way more messy and therefore better. Once the day is wrapped, I go back through every page of notes and move things either into my to-do app or onto my calendar. I\u0026rsquo;ve considered an iPad for this daylong writing, but I like paper. Again, the mess is what makes it great.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, I journal for 5-10 minutes. This is some of the most important writing I do each day. I focus on any decisions I made and my rationale for making them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDownstairs, dinner, books, bed, and hope to be just a little bit better tomorrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ca title=\"Permanent link for WFH\" href='https://audacious.blog/2020/wfh'\u003e\u0026nbsp;▲︎\u0026nbsp;\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n"

But more than hate, I think the bigger risk is making something to which people are indifferent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy not focus on hate? For starters, eliciting hate is actually quite hard to do if the product team is competent. Even talking with your customers once a week should steer you clear of danger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIndifference on the other hand is a product killer.

Some bloggers (or their designers) choose to hide \u003cem\u003ewhen\u003c/em\u003e a post was written. I usually see this via dates excluded from the URL and/or the page itself. Why they\u0026rsquo;re doing this, I\u0026rsquo;m not sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor URLs, I think dates are useful. Take this URL for example:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e/2019/dont-hide-the-date\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust looking at it, you have a sense of when it was written and what it might be about. Instantly. That\u0026rsquo;s a good user experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(My favorite URL approach is from sites like Medium, where they opt for the questionable /title-GI83R1SH article ID at the end of their post URLs which manages to thread the needle of being both impossible to guess and devoid of any date context. I call this URL style post-modern, because what starts out understandable quickly turns convoluted.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I understand not wanting extra cruft in your URLs. Having a clean website.com/post-title structure is attractive to my inner minimalist. Going title-only also makes it easier to recall the URL of a once-visited post, since you\u0026rsquo;re more likely to guess the title of an article than the title and date.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen there\u0026rsquo;s the date on the page itself. I generally see a lot of designs use the smallest type size or the faintest gray color possible—if they even include the date at all. I think that\u0026rsquo;s the wrong way to go. Whether the post is timely or timeless, dates provide a sense of place and serve as an important piece of context for your readers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou don\u0026rsquo;t have to overemphasize the \u003cem\u003ewhen\u003c/em\u003e something was written, but please don\u0026rsquo;t leave it out completely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ca title=\"Permanent link for Don’t Hide the Date\" href='https://audacious.blog/2019/dont-hide-the-date'\u003e\u0026nbsp;▲︎\u0026nbsp;\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n"

Let’s walk through the levels:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c!-- raw HTML omitted --\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"level-one-talk-with-your-customers-daily\"\u003eLevel one: talk with your customers daily.\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou simply won’t have enough information to make good product decisions if you’re not talking with your customers every day. Call them. Email them. Ask them what they like, what they don’t like, what they wish your product could do, where they’re indifferent. Would they recommend your product to someone else? Who? Why not?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"level-two-build-and-share-prototypes\"\u003eLevel two: build and share prototypes.\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou have customer feedback, and now it’s time to create solutions for their problems. A good product team should be able to quickly prototype (code, Figma, whatever) ideas that are Just Enough™ to demonstrate the value and begin to unearth usability issues. Prototypes should be lightweight and shareable with a single link.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"level-three-implement-lightweight-metrics\"\u003eLevel three: implement lightweight metrics.\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou’ve built some stuff and now it’s time to measure whether it worked. The metrics rabbit hole is rife with products and terms and general misdirection about what you truly need. Do a lot of reading, ignore most of it. A maturing product team does need some form of analytics and metrics to shore up what you’re hearing from customers—but you do not need to spend tens of thousands of dollars and two months integrating with one of the huge product analytics players right out of the gate. Not yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this level, you only need to answer two questions: (a) what do we track to tell if our stuff is working and (b) how will we report on this data. For (a), basic things like page views, clicks, and lower level database fields can help indicate behavior (Have they turned on feature X? Set a date field with the date they turn it on.) For (b), you’ll either need to have direct access to the database and some SQL knowledge (it’s not hard to get the basics) or a web-based tool that simplifies the reporting for you. There are a lot of tools out there, just be extremely judicious about giving database access to a third party.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"level-four-have-a-process-for-team-self-improvement\"\u003eLevel four: have a process for team self-improvement.\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDing. Welcome to level four. Enlightenment time. At this point, you should be completing enough create → ship → research cycles that recurring issues become apparent—especially if you’re looking at multiple product teams. Once you’ve identified these problem areas, you need to set aside time for growth and reflection. If you don’t, these small pains will become chronic injuries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCompanies that get stuck at this stage will hemorrhage good people. This is because good product people are used to improving through iteration, and they won’t hang around a company that doesn’t treat the team as its most important product. (Side note: your company is your most important product.) Self-improvement at this level can be as simple as design reviews, a book club, or team retrospectives. Just set aside time and do it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"level-five-refine-delivery-release-and-marketing-ops\"\u003eLevel five: refine delivery, release, and marketing ops.\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is the last one I could think of, and it’s all about making sure the people you’ve got doing the things on the bottom four levels are able to spend as much time there as possible. However, once you reach a certain size I think having a team or members of the team assisting in the delivery, release, and marketing of the things you ship can be a big time saver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegardless what you call it (product ops, project manager, etc.), it’s the acknowledgment that if you want product people talking to customers, creating prototypes, and looking at the data, then anything they do that aren’t those things is hurting the lower levels of the pyramid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat’s not here?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA lot. I’m certain this isn’t one-size fits all. But in general, I think if you pour time into one of these levels without an equal or greater amount of effort going into the level below it, you’re setting yourself up for problems later on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ca title=\"Permanent link for Hierarchy of product team needs\" href='https://audacious.blog/2019/product-team-needs'\u003e\u0026nbsp;▲︎\u0026nbsp;\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n"

It’s yellow, and fits perfectly in a pocket. It has a black-and-white screen with high reflectivity, a crystal-clear image, and no backlight. And of course, it has Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, USB-C, and a headphone jack. But it also has a crank. Yes, a crank: a cute, rotating analog controller that flips out from the side. It’s literally revolutionary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere’s more: Playdate includes games — a full season of them. The games will be delivered over-the-air, once a week for 12 weeks, and they’ll be a surprise: when the new game light flashes, you’ll never know what you’re about to play. Panic recruited some of the world’s best game designers — some well known; others under the radar — to make games exclusively for our system. Playdate isn’t just hardware: it’s a complete experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://kotaku.com/the-people-who-published-firewatch-are-now-making-a-gam-1834958316\"\u003eMike Fahey\u003c/a\u003e, \u003cem\u003eKotaku\u003c/em\u003e:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I received the Playdate announcement under embargo last week, I thought it was a joke. \u003ca href=\"https://panic.com/\"\u003ePanic\u003c/a\u003e is a company that makes web utility apps for smartphones and published adventure game Firewatch with Campo Santo.

Bright yellow with a black and white screen and with no spot for removable media like cartridges, the Playdate is more or less self-contained, except of course for the charger and wireless connection. And it’s over the wireless connection that the games come: 12 of them, exclusives created by well-known developers like Keita Takahashi (Katamari Damacy), Bennett Foddy (Getting Over It) and Zach Gage (Ridiculous Fishing).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.macstories.net/news/panic-reveals-plans-to-sell-a-handheld-gaming-system-called-the-playdate-in-2020/\"\u003eJohn Voorhees\u003c/a\u003e, \u003cem\u003eMacStories\u003c/em\u003e:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlaydate\u0026rsquo;s hardware is not like anything currently available on the market, and Panic says the device isn\u0026rsquo;t meant to compete with other handheld systems either.

(Crying I assume over what we had given him for lunch.) Based on how many times we\u0026rsquo;ve initiated Alexa so far, our unintentional activation rate is around 2.5%. That\u0026rsquo;s\u0026hellip; bad? I\u0026rsquo;m not sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePart of this is the compromise of even bringing these devices into our homes—we trade manually setting kitchen timers and looking up measurement conversions for the convenience of an always-present assistant that also happens to be a recording device connected to the Internet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, I\u0026rsquo;d feel better if Amazon had \u003cem\u003eless\u003c/em\u003e information about me and I was \u003cem\u003emore\u003c/em\u003e aware of when Alexa was listening.

[\u0026hellip;]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich brings us to the $132 million question: who\u0026rsquo;s going to pay $50 every year for this? People dissatisfied with the unlimited free clickbait available elsewhere? Gulls, rubes, and saps? Dogs with credit cards? Mr. Williams has always preferred to frame Medium in gauzy platitudes\u0026mdash;what I called his \u0026ldquo;Bellagio buffet of delicious nonsense\u0026rdquo;. Once upon a time, this seemed like the benign puffery of the ultrawealthy. Billionaire-splaining. Today, as the gulf between the promise of Medium and the reality yawns ever larger, it seems like abject denial. Again\u0026mdash;has Mr. Williams actually spent time on Medium recently? If so, it hasn\u0026rsquo;t made a dent. If not, I can hardly blame him. It\u0026rsquo;s awful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ca title=\"Permanent link for Medium, Seven Years Later\" href='https://audacious.blog/2019/butterick-on-mediums-history'\u003e\u0026nbsp;▲︎\u0026nbsp;\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n"

Thankfully Laura Hazard Owen, writing for the Nieman Journalism Lab, was more than up to the task:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy spend so much time worrying about what Medium is? Maybe because we wanted to know whether it was a friend or an enemy. The answer is that it’s neither. It’s a reflection of what the media industry has worried about, and hoped for, and not received. But Medium was never something that we would get to define. Instead, it’s turned out to be an endless thought experiment into what publishing on the internet could look like. That’s not much fun for people who got burned along the way, but Medium was never exactly ours to begin with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMs. Owen\u0026rsquo;s resulting timeline is filled with bite-sized notable events from Medium\u0026rsquo;s history, starting \u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/@ev/welcome-to-medium-9e53ca408c48\"\u003ewith the August 2012 launch\u003c/a\u003e, in which Founder and CEO Ev Williams heralded the site as, “a beautiful space for reading and writing — and little else.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe following ~90 events, covering seven years, contain some fun trivia you might have forgotten.

There are three letters on each side, and players must connect them to make words at least three letters long. Letters on the same side cannot be used consecutively, and the final letter of each word becomes the first letter of the next word. The goal is to use all 12 letters in as few words as possible. “It’s a lot faster, it’s a much quicker hit, but you can kind of keep playing that too forever,” said [Times’s Games Expansion Team Lead] Von Ehren.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI really like this game. Whereas crosswords are built from a preset list of words, a round \u003cem\u003eLetter Boxed\u003c/em\u003e is almost entirely freeform and relies on the vocabulary you know. My current strategy is to rotate between using long and short words, and it\u0026rsquo;s been working out OK this week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only caveat to \u003cem\u003eLetter Boxed\u003c/em\u003e (right now, at least) is that you need a \u003cem\u003eTimes\u003c/em\u003e subscription to play. It\u0026rsquo;s not such a great game to justify a subscription if you don\u0026rsquo;t also read the paper, but it is a nice addition for current subscribers.
