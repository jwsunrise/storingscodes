title: DuckDuckGo!
---

DuckDuckGo, the privacy-focused search engine, just announced a new partnership with Yahoo. This partnership isn't necessarily new, perhaps more _renewed_, as DuckDuckGo has utilized Yahoo's BOSS (Build Your Own Search Service) API [for years][yahoointerview]. That said, I wasn't sure what DuckDuckGo was going to do when Yahoo announced it was [discontinuing the BOSS API earlier this year][byeboss]. 

Now we know. 

DuckDuckGo will continue to get results, and a few extra features like date filtering on results, from Yahoo by way of a custom integrations between each service. Here's the text over on the _Yahoo_ subdomain [duckduckgo-owned-server.yahoo.net](https://duckduckgo-owned-server.yahoo.net): 

> This DuckDuckGo owned server is operating on a subdomain (duckduckgo-owned-server.yahoo.net) that has been [delegated to DuckDuckGo via DNS](https://duck.co/help/results/yahoo-technical-implementation) by Yahoo so that we can continue to protect your privacy. In accordance with our [privacy policy](https://duckduckgo.com/privacy), we never share any personal information with any of our partners, including Yahoo. To make that crystal clear, Yahoo itself published a [privacy statement](https://help.yahoo.com/kb/search-for-desktop/SLN27299.html) to that effect. For more information, you can read about our [partnership with Yahoo](https://duck.co/help/company/yahoo-partnership) and its [technical implementation](https://duck.co/help/results/yahoo-technical-implementation). 

Essentially, DuckDuckGo gets to control the core components of the integration, which should allow them maintain their previous privacy commitments. I'm not sure if DuckDuckGo is the only service to get a deal like this, but their [335 million search queries last month][ddgstats] probably didn't hurt negotiations. If you read between the lines, Yahoo needed this more than DuckDuckGo did.
