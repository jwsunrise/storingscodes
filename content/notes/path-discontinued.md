<!-- [Harrison Weber][giz], *Gizmodo*, on the recently announced discontinuing of 'personal network' Path: 

> At the time, the company was addressing a real problem—social network fatigue—but the problem wasn’t as pertinent as it is today. Facebook had taken over the web by then, and the rise of things like Farmville made the service plenty irritating, but Facebook still had novelty left in it. It hadn’t yet fully taken over our smartphones and it didn’t own WhatsApp or Instagram. We were still years away from Zuckerberg’s nauseating congressional testimony.

> It’s possible that Path simply arrived too early, because the need for something like Path wasn’t so pressing back then. Facebook didn’t seem entirely unbeatable yet, and the app wasn’t nearly so globally relevant. But today, now that Facebook has become the least personal way on Earth to communicate, where semi-automated actions like Happy Birthday wishes get corralled onto our Timelines en masse, the idea behind Path sounds charming and quaint and good. It would have been nice if Path had actually accomplished its mission, instead of persisting until now in obscurity.

[According to Dunbar's Number][dunbar], "humans can comfortably maintain only 150 stable relationships." Path, at its core, was a social network built around this idea. When the service launched, you could only have 50 friends. They later expanded that number to 150 (and then 500), but in those early years the network limitation forced you to only connect with people who *really* mattered to you. No old high school acquaintances, no business fan pages. Just you and your closest friends or family.[^1]

Additionally, Path benefited from being an attractive competitor to Facebook at a time when you *could* get your friends and family to switch social networks. Today, Facebook's too large to directly compete with, even if your defining feature is one they'd never want to copy. I [want to believe][a better path] the ideals of Path could be repackaged and relaunched today, but you would need *a lot* of money to keep a free social network afloat for long enough to *maybe* reach the critical mass necessary for advertising or subscriptions to sustain the service. 

Anyhow — adieu, Path. You were the social network we needed but never deserved.
