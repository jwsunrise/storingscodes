title: 'PCWorldâ€™s Review of Firewatch: 3/5'
---

Last one for the night. Hayden Dingman, [covering the game for PCWorld][pcworld]: 

> _Firewatch_ is beautiful. _Firewatch_ is intriguing. But ultimately I don't think _Firewatch_ is very good. At its best, this is a quiet game about two characters struggling with real-life insecurities. But when that's sidelined to make room for a main plot, _Firewatch_ suffers. It's a game perfect for trailers, a game full of excellent dialogue and breathtaking moments and stunning vistas that ultimately amounts to nothing much at all.

Both [Metacritic] and [OpenCritic], sites that aggregate reviews, peg _Firewatch_ at 82/100. I don't expect _Firewatch_ to set the world on fire, but I feel it's going to be one of those games that raises the bar. Knockout graphics, great voice acting. Expect to hear about this one for the next couple of weeks.
