Indie studio [Snowman] and the brilliant artist/developer [Harry Nesbitt] have created a simple, yet stunning, sequel to the sublime, endless snowboarding game [*Alto's Adventure*][adventure]. It's the type of game that feels larger than your phone screen, which is fitting, because you'll be wishing for something bigger to fully appreciate the visuals and art direction. 

I'd recommend *Odyssey* at twice the price. [For $5][itunes], it's a steal.
