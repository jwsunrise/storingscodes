Nick Heer, *Pixel Envy*: 

> You know how you sometimes just need a quick place to jot something down — a single scrap of paper, the back of an envelope, or whatever you have laying around — and you know you won’t need to save it? Edit is like the digital version of that. It’s fast, it’s simple, and I use it all the time. 

I hate how he explained Edit better in 58 words than I [could in 200+](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1231744746).
