title: Blizzard to Transition Away From Battle.net Name
---

Blizzard Entertainment, regarding the deprecation and diversification of what was once collectively called Battle.net: 

> Battle.net technology will continue to serve as the central nervous system for Blizzard gamesâ€”nothing is changing in that regard. We'll just be referring to our various products and services using the Blizzard name instead. You've already seen this recently with things like "Blizzard Streaming" and "Blizzard Voice," and more changes are on the way.

I always thought Battle.net was a great name (and domain), but as Blizzard has grown and expanded into other areas, it makes sense to start branding their technologies directly under the company's name.
