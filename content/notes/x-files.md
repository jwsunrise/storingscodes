# ðŸ‘‹ Hi!

Welcome at my new website: jwb.co

The last couple of months (years...?) I've dabbled with building a personal website. Do I need a website? Nope. But I like to build and design stuff. For my job this is what I do a lot, but having something personal on the web is new for me. I don't have any social media accounts (I hate Facebook and Twitter), so having a place to put something online is nice. And what better place than my own website.
