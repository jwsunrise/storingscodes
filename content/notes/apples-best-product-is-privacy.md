John Patrick Pullen, _Time_: 

> There's this photo of my kids in the bath that, well, I'd rather not tell you about. I mean, it's incredibly cute and I'd love to show it to you, but I'm also a private person, so it wouldn't be right to go into details. But I will say this: though it's one of my favorite possessions, this picture doesn't physically exist. [...]

> As precious as this image is, I don't have it stored on a flash drive attached to my keychain, or in some other ultra-safe place. Instead, it's housed on a server in some unknown probably dank and sunless location. That's no casual decision. I've put considerable time and thought into how I store my photos in general, as well as how I back up my information overall. Despite all the bottomless storage features offered by tech giants like [Google](http://fortune.com/fortune500/alphabet/) and [Amazon](http://fortune.com/fortune500/amazon-com/), I default to keeping my most valuable data with [Apple](http://fortune.com/fortune500/apple/). Why I chose this matters, so let's talk about it.
