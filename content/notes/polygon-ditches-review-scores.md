Executive Editor and co-founder at *Polygon*, Chris Plante: 

> Games have changed since we launched Polygon. We're changing with them. 

> We believe that a new strategy, focusing on *criticism* and *curation*, will better serve our readers than the serviceable but ultimately limited reviews rubric that, for decades, has functioned as a load-bearing pillar of most game publications.

> As part of this evolution, Polygon will no longer score reviews.

*Polygon's* updated review strategy is built around two new programs: [Recommends](https://www.polygon.com/recommends) (labeling to endorse a particular title) and [Essentials](https://www.polygon.com/essentials) (curated lists of the best games available). As Mr. Plante [points out](https://twitter.com/plante/status/1037049092998881280), *Polygon* is following the lead of [*Kotaku*][k], [*Waypoint*][w], and [*Eurogamer*][e]; all of which have stepped away from numerical score systems. 

This is a good move for *Polygon* and, I'd argue, any video game review site. When it comes to reviews, 5-star scales [are](https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/16/14952434/netflix-five-star-ratings-going-away-thumbs-up-down) [worthless](https://techcrunch.com/2009/09/22/youtube-comes-to-a-5-star-realization-its-ratings-are-useless/), let alone the 10-point variant sites like *Polygon* previously used. If it were up to me, I'd make all review sites use a simple thumbs up/down grade and maybe a "neutral" for something not terrible nor worth endorsing. A thumbs up tells me the game is worth playing — a `7.6/10` doesn't.
