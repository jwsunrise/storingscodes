> "I prefer not to use the generally used term 'open world' when developing software, but we used this term [at E3] in order to make it easier for consumers to understand. This term means that there is a large world in which players can do numerous things daily." 

That's Shigeru Miyamoto at Nintendo's latest shareholders meeting, reported on by Lucy O'Brien, for IGN.

"Open world" might be one of the most tortured terms in gaming today. I'm not crazy about "vast," but good on Nintendo for attempting to draw a distinction. In fact, I'm glad they did; an open world Zelda title wouldn't be a Zelda title.
