Megan Farokhmanesh, *The Verge*: 

> Telltale Games, creators of episodic adventure games like *The Walking Dead*, *The Wolf Among Us*, and *Batman: The Enemy Within*, laid off a large number of its staff today. The company will retain a small team of 25. According to multiple sources *The Verge* spoke with, employees were let go with no severance.

> "Today Telltale Games made the difficult decision to begin a majority studio closure following a year marked by insurmountable challenges," [the company said in a statement](https://twitter.com/telltalegames/status/1043252010999410689). "A majority of the company's employees were dismissed earlier this morning." The remaining employees will stay on "to fulfill the company's obligations to its board and partners," according to Telltale.

Co-founder and former CEO Kevin Bruner (he left Telltale over a year ago), [on his personal site][kb]: 

> Today, I’m mostly saddened for the people who are losing their jobs at a studio they love. And I’m also saddened at the loss of a studio that green-lit crazy ideas that no one else would consider. I’m comforted a bit knowing there are now so many new talented people and studios creating games in the evolving narrative genre. While I look forward to those games and new developments, and continuing to contribute, I will always find “A Telltale Game” to have been a unique offering.

This news comes several months after Ms. Farokhmanesh first reported [on the turmoil inside of Telltale Games][verge tt] following their meteoric rise. Yet, a few months after Ms. Farokhmanesh's reporting, the studio announced it had (among other developments) [partnered with Netflix][tt st] to create a game adaptation of *Stranger Things*, which led me to believe things were getting a little bit better. 

I really [wanted them to pull through][af tt]. Telltale had some of the best art- and narrative-driven games I've ever played. There was a lot of talent inside that studio, and I hope they all end up alright.
