Nice overview of Liverpool F.C. by Kevin Draper for the *New York Times*, in which he correctly identifies the club's primary advantage — its manager: 

> The birth of the new Liverpool may have been Oct. 8, 2015, the day F.S.G. announced the hiring of [Jürgen] Klopp, the former Borussia Dortmund manager. In less than three years, Klopp has become the exuberant, [backslapping and hugging](https://twitter.com/LFC/status/1014522254724599808) face of the club. His aggressive [gegenpressing, or counterpressing](https://spielverlagerung.com/2014/10/07/counter-or-gegenpressing/), system is the key to Liverpool's ruthless attack, and it can be a pleasure to watch --- provided you're not supporting the team being subjected to it

Klopp's enthusiasm during matches is absolutely intoxicating.
