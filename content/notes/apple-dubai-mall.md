title: Apple Dubai Mall Opens With Unique ‘Solar Wings’ Design
---

Apple PR: 

> To mitigate Dubai’s climate, Foster + Partners designed eighteen 37.5-foot-high motorized “Solar Wings” that respond to the ever-changing environmental conditions. When the sun is at its hottest they cool the store, and in the evenings they open to welcome everyone to the public terrace. Inspired by the the traditional Arabic Mashrabiya, each “Solar Wing” is locally fabricated from 340 carbon fiber reinforced polymer rods, and at 180 feet wide, the 18 panels make up one of the world’s largest kinetic art installations.

To see the “Solar Wings” in action, check out the gif, about halfway down the press release. Absolutely mesmerizing to watch.
