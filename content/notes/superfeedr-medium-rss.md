title: Medium Now Supports RSS
---

Julien Genestoux, founder of recently-acquired-by-Medium Superfeedr, on enabling full-content RSS for Medium publications and users: 

> As we want the open web to remain strong, we were delighted to find that the folks at Medium share the same values. And we think that Superfeedr's acquisition is a powerful indicator of Medium's support for open protocols. As an example of this, my first commit at Medium was to enable full content RSS feeds both for publications and users (available [in your settings](https://medium.com/me/settings)).  

[Truncated RSS is not RSS][twitter]. I don't know why full-content RSS wasn't enabled from the get-go, and I don't buy that it took an acquisition for Medium to get it done. Better late than never, though.
