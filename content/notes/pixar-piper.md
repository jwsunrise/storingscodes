title: A Look at Pixar’s New Short Film ‘Piper’
---

Sabrina Imbler, writing for Audubon: 

> To create Piper, Barillaro and his entire team entered the Sanderlings’ world. They spent weekends on beaches all over the Bay Area, meeting at 5 a.m. on a dusty road under a bridge in search of the birds. “Half of us were chasing around different beaches and calling each other on cell phones until we found a flock we could get close to,” Barillaro says. “It became this treasure hunt.”

Whenever I read about Pixar's process, I smile, because they go all in on the small things. We're going to see "Finding Dory" tonight, but I'm almost always more excited to see Pixar's newest short films.
