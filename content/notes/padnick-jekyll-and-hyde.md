Steven Padnick: 

> And when I say everybody, I mean everybody. Not just most people today don’t understand the original story—though that’s true—but every retelling of the story, from the earliest stage plays to Steven Moffat’s otherwise brilliant miniseries Jekyll, misses a key point of Robert Louis Stevenson’s original story:

> There is no Mr. Hyde.

Spoilers, obviously. Does that even need said, if the title is more than 100 years old? 

Mr. Padnick's take is different than the one I came away with post-reading, but I really enjoyed his analysis. Considering our current damp and dark October, and the fact [there's a Kindle version for just $1.99](http://a.co/hj8AxEe), it might be time to revisit Stevenson's classic.
