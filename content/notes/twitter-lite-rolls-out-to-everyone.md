Twitter's calling it the "new twitter.com", but this update [is clearly the lite variant](https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2017/introducing-twitter-lite.html) of their website that mobile users have been using for over a year. Good on them for pushing this out to everyone—I've found it to be significantly faster and nicer to use than the normal site. It's also ([sadly](https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/16/17021960/twitter-mac-desktop-app-discontinued-support-ending)) the best official way to use Twitter on your Mac. 

If you're still seeing the old/current version, you can check out what's coming by going directly to [mobile.twitter.com](https://mobile.twitter.com).
