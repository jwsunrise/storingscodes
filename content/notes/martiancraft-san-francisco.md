title: ‘So is San Francisco really the perfect system font for Apple’s products? It’s
  complicated.’
---

MartianCraft's Nick Keppol wrote two _incredibly_ detailed posts on the typographic strengths and weaknesses of Apple's new sans-serif typeface. [Part one][mc] looks at San Francisco in contrast with Lucida Grande, Helvetica Neue, and DIN. [Part two][mc2] focuses on San Francisco's various weights, with particular interest paid to the nuances between San Francisco UI, Text, and Compact.

I have a non-Retina Macbook Pro, and the general legibility of OS X was dramatically increased after I upgraded to El Capitan. San Francisco is so good that apps still using Lucida Grande or Helvetica Neue stick out like a sore thumb.
