title: "Next AP Stylebook Drops the Hypen, Capital ‘S’ From ‘Esports’"
---

Announced at last weekend's American Copy Editors Society meeting, the Associated Press now recommends referring to competitive video games as 'esports', not 'eSports' or 'e-sports'. 

I consider the AP Stylebook one of the more liberal style guide, but giving esports the same treatment as email, both lowercased and hyphen-less, is indicative of a significant trend in public perception and usage. According to the AP, esports are now mainstream. 

(I count 12 colleges that [offer varsity esports programs][games edu] (with a surprisingly strong showing from my home state), and in 2014, video game 'League of Legends' drew [27 million viewers][espn] for its final match, which was more than that year's final games of the World Series (23.5 million) or NBA Finals (18 million).)
