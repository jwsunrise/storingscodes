Google Inbox, the gesture-driven email experiment that turned your inbox into an actionable list of tasks, is going away at the end of March 2019. I get why they're shutting it down — Google wants to focus their efforts on Gmail, which recently [received a brand new UI][new gmail] — but I'm still disappointed. Inbox made it easy to keep your, uh, inbox tidy  because the app grouped related types of messages; allowing you to send an entire category to the archive with a single swipe. I don't mind Mail on iOS, but Inbox always felt a bit faster for interfacing with Gmail, and Mail probably won't ever support Google's unique approach to labels-as-folders.
