Here's the thing about Nick Heer's [yearly][ios 8] [iOS][ios 9] [reviews][ios 10]: They're my favorite iOS pieces to read. Aside from the great writing and photos, Mr. Heer crafts some of the most cogent, contextual conversations about iOS that I get to read on the web. These aren't short reviews, but they're edited well. 

This year, Mr. Heer changed up his format to be less about the details and more about the holistic impact of iOS 11 on you and your devices. It's a new angle, but I dig it. Get some coffee, and go enjoy.
