> Visions is a new quarterly publication that aims to introduce science fiction to a wider audience. Mixing classic texts and new writing, it focuses on short stories to reflect the breadth of style and ideas within the genre.

No word on pricing, but everything about this intrigues me. Theyâ€™re also using a typeface called [Marvin Visions][mv], which, to my eyes, is a perfect pairing of font to content.
