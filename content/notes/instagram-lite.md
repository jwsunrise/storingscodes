Josh Constine, *TechCrunch*: 

> At just 573 kilobytes, Instagram Lite is 1/55th the size of Instagram’s 32 megabyte main app. It lets you filter and post photos to the feed or Stories, watch Stories, and browse the Explore page, but currently lacks the options to share videos or Direct message friends.

First, the photo-only version of Instagram was the best version. Second, what in the sweet heavens is in the current Instagram app that makes it 55x larger than Instagram Lite? Trick question — it's always the ads, analytics, and A/B testing frameworks. 

Again I say, [your "lite" app should be your only app][lite].
