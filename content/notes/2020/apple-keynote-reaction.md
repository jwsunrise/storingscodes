- No USB C. Really? Still no USB C? MacBooks, iPad Pro, iPad Air: USB C. iPhone? Apple: "nope".
- No charger and no headphones in the box. Because of ~~the environment~~ money. Apple says that everyone has a charger allready. But then they ship a USB C to lightning cable in the box. No one has a USB C charger so it's useless for a lot of people. But hey: ~~money~~ environment.  
- The notch is there. And it's still crazy big. For no reason. There are finger print readers. They do excist Apple. The notch looks old. Very old compared to todays android phones.
- Why was there a 10 minute Verizon add? I'm from Europe. I don't care about Verizon. Or 5G. Or Verizon 5G. No normal person cares about 5G.
