No USB C. Still no USB C. Why?  
No charger and no headphones in the box. Because of ~~the environment~~ money.  
Apple says that everyone has a charger allready. But then they ship a USB C to lightning cable in the box. No one has a USB C charger so it's useless for a lot of people. But hey: environment.  
The notch is there. And it's still crazy big. For no reason. It looks old. Very old compared to todays android phones.
