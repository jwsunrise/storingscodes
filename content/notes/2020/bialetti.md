I've bought a Bialetti Macincaffee coffee grinder last week. It's a manual grinder that costs about 30 euro. 
I've been looking for a coffee grinder for a long time, but I don't know what I want. 
When bying coffee, I asked for advice about grinders and the sales guy recommended this Bialetti one. 

Conclusion: I like it! It's my first "real" grinder. It makes a real difference when making coffee, and I like my morning coffee even more now.
