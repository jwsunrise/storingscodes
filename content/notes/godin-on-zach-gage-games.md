Derek Godin, writing about iOS developer/designer Zach Gage and his newest game, *Pocket-Run Pool*: 

> Gage specializes in taking well-worn casual game mainstays (word puzzles, chess, solitaire) and twisting them in small, clever ways. Often these are simple mechanical tweaks; *Really Bad Chess* gives players one king and 15 other random pieces to duke it out with, while *Sage Solitaire* elegantly splits the difference between classic Klondike and poker. His latest game [*Pocket-Run Pool*](http://www.pocketrunpool.com/) is his version of an arcade-style billiards game, with rotating pocket multipliers and three lives (i.e. scratches) to clear the table.

A Zach Gage remix is the best kind of remix. *Pocket-Run Pool* is certainly enjoyable, but [*Really Bad Chess*][rbc] remains one of my favorite games on iOS.
