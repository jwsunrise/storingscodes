[Benjamin Mullin](http://www.poynter.org/2017/how-will-wikitribune-actually-work-heres-the-man-responsible-for-figuring-it-out/469293/), _Poynter_: 

> There's still much to be determined about [WikiTribune](https://www.wikitribune.com/), the as-yet unlaunched community news platform dreamed up by Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales. How many stories will it publish per day? How will it decide what's news? How will volunteers work alongside professional journalists?

> But as of this morning, WikiTribune has settled on the person responsible for answering those questions. Peter Bale, who was previously chief executive officer of the Center for Public Integrity and vice president of CNN International, has been named WikiTribune's launch editor, in charge of turning Wales' vision for a community-driven news organization into a reality.
