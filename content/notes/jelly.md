Biz Stone, on the "un-pivot" relaunch of Jelly, his Q&A social network: 

> Back in the day, folks would turn to friends with questions. Then came the web and search engines. These days most of us go straight to a search engine. Increasingly, people are asking on social media (which can sometimes be awkward). We think there is another way to get high quality answers without sifting through an ocean of “results.”

I laughed at the asking-questions-on-social-media-is-awkward bit, because I'll bet you Jelly's iOS app prompts for access to my Twitter accounts or Contacts, so they can find those people who, you know, it was awkward to ask things before.
