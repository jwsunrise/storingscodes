Yesterday, the United States Men's National Team—with a 2-1 loss to Trinidad and Tobago—failed to qualify for next year's World Cup. The last time this happened was 1986. 

A lot of things went wrong to get us here, but I'm still upset. A few brief, emotional, and irrational thoughts: 

- Missing the World Cup will take a lot of wind out of the sails for United States soccer. It really felt like we were building up some good momentum, too. 
- Unlike other [World * events][world series], the World Cup is actually a worldwide competition, which makes it objectively[^1] cooler.  
- The World Cup is only held every four years, which means I still have the rest of 2017 to finish before the four-year-countdown can start. 
- Does this mean no new jerseys? If there's one thing a World Cup could guarantee, it's that some designer at Nike would tweak a gradient on the old kits, and we'd be happy to pay for it. 
- Who do I root for now?
