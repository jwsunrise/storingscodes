I've [linked to Marvin Visions before]({{< ref "/notes/triay-on-marvin-visions.md" >}}), but I simply can't get over how great this font looks. The latest update makes Marvin Visions available as a *variable* font, which means you have granular control over both weight and optical size without a dramatic increase in file size. There's a two-dimensional slider about a quarter of the way down the page if you want to see what I mean.
