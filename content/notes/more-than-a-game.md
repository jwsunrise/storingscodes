title: How Video Games Are Changing the Way Soccer Is Played
---

Rory Smith for the New York Times: 

> Before his first few appearances as a teenage striker for Arsenal, Alex Iwobi used to cast his eye over the names of the opposition team, trying to identify his direct opponent.

> In most cases, he would find himself up against a player he had never faced. His manager, Arsène Wenger, and Arsenal’s coaching staff would offer counsel, but in lieu of experience Iwobi also would turn to another trusted resource.

> “I’d look at his name,” he said, “and then try to remember how good he was on [FIFA].”

Other sports video games have similar systems for viewing digital player data, but none have the same global reach or popularity as FIFA.
