Nintendo: 906,000 Nintendo Switch consoles and over 1.3 million copies of _The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild_ (925,000 for Nintendo Switch + 460,000 for Wii U) were sold in the U.S. this March. According to Nintendo, this makes the Nintendo Switch and _Breath of the Wild_ two of the fastest selling systems and games of all time. 

Impressive numbers, and all during a month not traditionally known for console launches.
