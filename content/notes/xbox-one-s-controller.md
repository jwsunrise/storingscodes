title: The Next Webâ€™s Review of the Xbox One S Controller

New design, better connectivity, built-in Bluetooth. Looks nice. For an extra $20, you can [order a color-customized version][xbdl], but the default colors look perfectly acceptable to my eyes. 

The original Xbox One may have been an ugly black box, but Microsoft's controller designs have repeatedly outdistanced Sony's own attempts. This latest iteration continues the trend.
