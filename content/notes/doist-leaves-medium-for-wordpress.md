Looks like Doist started with Medium [in 2017](https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://blog.doist.com), and then switched to WP Engine—a WordPress hosting service—earlier this month. 

(You might not recognize Doist-the-company, but you've probably heard of their most popular product: [Todoist](https://todoist.com), the much loved cross-platform task manager.)
