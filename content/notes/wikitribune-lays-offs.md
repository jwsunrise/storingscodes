Nick Statt, *The Verge*: 

> Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales' digital media company, the WikiTribune, is shifting its focus away from traditional news-gathering and moving to a "community oriented" strategy that prioritizes working with contributors. 

> In the process, the company has laid off its 12 original editorial staffers, [reports The Drum](https://www.thedrum.com/news/2018/10/22/wikitribune-restructures-around-community-following-editorial-exodus), following the April departure of CNN and Reuters journalist Peter Bale, who initially assembled the team. The WikiTribune began in August of last year, and Wales and his co-founder Orit Kopel [posted a note to the site earlier this week](https://www.wikitribune.com/project/what-we-have-learned-so-far/) first mentioning the "major personnel changes" and the reframing of its focus on the community.

The original idea was to have professional journalists working side-by-side with the community to create an 'evidence-based' news site. Without the editorial staff, how is WikiTribune any different from Wikipedia's [portal for current events][wiki current] or [Wikinews]?
