[Luke Plunkett][kotaku], _Kotaku_: 

> So while it’s tempting to spend pages here banging on about the specific ways in which _PES 2018's_ mastery of the actual sport of football (as it’s played) is unmatched, or just what it is about _FIFA_ that makes it irresistible every year in spite of its glaring flaws, I’m just going to cut to the chase.

> _PES 2018_ is the better game this year because it plays a better game of football. Sorry if that sounds predictable, since that’s been the case for the last few years, but it’s the case again in 2017. 

I [prefer _PES_ to _FIFA_]({{< ref "pes-vs-fifa.md" >}}), but Mr. Plunkett nails the core problems with Konami's title: clunky menus, lack of licenses, and commentary you want to turn off entirely.
