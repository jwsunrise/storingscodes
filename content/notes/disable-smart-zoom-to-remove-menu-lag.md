When you perform a right-click in MacOS via the trackpad — by clicking or tapping with two fingers — there's a small delay before you see the contextual menu appear. Apparently, to my delight, this lag [can be removed][reddit] by disabling the "Smart zoom" gesture, relieving MacOS from waiting a few milliseconds to see if another two-finger tap/click was on the way, which would indicate you wanted to zoom the current content.

Thankfully, I never use this zoom feature (pinch-to-zoom is more precise anyhow), and I was able to disable the gesture by going to:

`System Preferences > Trackpad > Scroll & Zoom` 

and then unchecking "Smart zoom". It's amazing how much faster my secondary click feels now — the contextual menu appears instantly. Sometimes it's the small things.
