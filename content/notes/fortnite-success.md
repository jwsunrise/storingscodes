Brian Feldman for *New York Magazine*, in a piece titled, "The Most Important Video Game on the Planet": 

> Analysts estimate that *Fortnite* is currently raking in more than $300 million a month, and has made its maker, Epic Games, more than $1.2 billion since its battle royale mode launched in late September. That’s all from a game that’s free to download and play unrestricted. 

To clarify: anything you can buy in *Fortnite* is purely cosmetic and doesn't give you a better chance at winning. You buy outfits or dance moves to taunt your friends with. We [know microtransactions are a profitable business plan]({{< ref "/notes/activision-matchmaking-and-microtransactions-patent.md" >}}), but even Epic's success here is somewhat staggering. 

The article goes into a few reasons why *Fortnite* — not the first game to have a battle royale mode — is currently experiencing a moment. A combination of wide availability (it's on almost every game console and smartphone you can think of), cartoon-style graphics, and kid-friendly goofy "violence" (there's no blood when you eliminate an opponent) leaves you with a game that's literally everywhere and enjoyed by seemingly everyone. 

One final bit from Mr. Feldman's piece that caught my eye was this aside about one of *Fortnite's* most famous players, Tyler "Ninja" Blevins: 

> Ninja, whose real name is Tyler Blevins, makes an estimated half a million dollars every month streaming *Fortnite* rounds on Twitch, a service for livestreaming video games that is owned by Amazon. 

I don't know which scenario is more astonishing: Epic making $300 million a month from a free-to-play game, or Ninja collecting $500,000 in the same amount of time for *playing* said game.
