Over at *The Sweet Setup*, I spent a few thousand words exploring some of the best text editors available for MacOS. Few topics start such heated debates as those about why one text editor might be better than another, but I don't think you can go wrong with any of the apps on our list. 

Also, if you're not reading [*The Sweet Setup*][tss] or [*Tools and Toys*][tt] already, you really shouldâ€”they're great publications, backed by a fantastic team.
