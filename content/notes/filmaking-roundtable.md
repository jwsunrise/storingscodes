title: The Hollywood Reporterâ€™s Hour With Ridley Scott, Tarantino, and More

A roundtable on filmmaking, [with the filmmakers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ7qKKQrSBY). Scott is incredibly measured, Tarantino is quintessentially eccentric, and I enjoyed whenever the discussion turned to them talking about their own writing.
