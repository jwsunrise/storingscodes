Nick Stat, *The Verge*: 

> Google has officially removed the Hangouts brand from its enterprise G Suite offering with the rebranding of Hangouts Chat as Google Chat, the company confirmed to *The Verge* on Thursday. The rebranding follows a similar name change, [confirmed yesterday], from the companion videoconferencing app Hangouts Meet to Google Meet.

> This latest modification was first hinted at by an [updated G Suite support document][doc] listing the Google Chat name alongside Google Meet. Of course, this version of Chat is not to be confused with the *other* version of Chat, the name Google inexplicably gave its [relatively new RCS-based Android messaging protocol][rcs].

> As for the Hangouts brand, it will continue to live on as the name of the consumer chat app that Google spun out of its shutdown social network Google+ back in 2013 as a spiritual successor to Gchat. “There will be no changes to the consumer (classic) version of Hangouts,” a Google spokesperson tells *The Verge*.

Who thought changing the *recognized* name of a product currently experiencing unprecedented demand was a good idea? Not that this will hurt their SEO, mind you.
