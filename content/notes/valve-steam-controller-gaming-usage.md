When you think of gaming on a PC, you might imagine using a keyboard and mouse. But according to [Valve's own statistics][steam stats], almost half of their [supposed 125 million Steam accounts][steam accounts] have connected some form of an external controller. What does this tell us? Nothing particularly interesting, except that the Xbox's majority share reaffirms my belief that Microsoft makes some of the best console controllers on the market.
