I remain [highly skeptical][af chrome] of Google — who made [$27.2 billion in ad revenue][ads] last quarter — having any say in what ads Chrome will or won't display. That said, the initial launch and implementation of Chrome's native ad filtering seems honest enough, for now.

If, however, the whole thing leaves you feeling a bit icky, [Firefox Quantum][download firefox] is a great alternative to Chrome. I've [been using it][firefox] for the past few months and have yet to find a reason to switch back.
