The Medium Exodus of 2018 continues. This week, it's a tweet from CTO and co-founder of Basecamp, David Heinemeier Hansson (DHH):

> After further review, we're going to be leaving Medium at some point in the near-to-mid-term future. Thanks for all the fish,[@ev](https://mobile.twitter.com/ev)! You built a beautiful typewriter, the early community was awesome, and I respect trying something different. Shame about the VC pressures. Adieu!

If you're not familiar with *Signal v. Noise*, it's a well-known "publication about the web" with almost [20 years of history](https://signalvnoise.com/popular). I've been reading *Signal v. Noise* for over a decade now, and their strong opinions on product, design, and business tend to be succinct and influential in those communities. 

I was always a bit surprised that Basecamp — staunchly in support of companies that [choose profit over potential growth](https://m.signalvnoise.com/why-we-choose-profit-e511efc4dcb9) — would go all-in with a platform like Medium. A VC-funded, zero profit publishing company that restricts your ability to control the design of your content felt like the antithesis to what *Signal v. Noise* was all about. I'm not sure where they'll go next (their previous blog was a homegrown Rails app), but if they're not going back to something in-house I could see them trying out [Ghost](https://ghost.org); the 2.0 release [looks slick](https://blog.ghost.org/2-0/). 

Regardless, this isn't a great sign for Medium. Ever since they [dropped support for custom domains][medium domains], I don't see why any new publications would seriously consider moving there. And if you already have a custom domain with Medium, I'd urge you to start looking at alternatives. 

I should really just put that in my site's header.
