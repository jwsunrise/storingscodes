Between art historian Andrew Tallon's [laser scanning of the entire cathedral](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/06/150622-andrew-tallon-notre-dame-cathedral-laser-scan-art-history-medieval-gothic/) in 2015 and the [incredibly detailed models](https://www.theverge.com/2014/10/31/7132587/assassins-creed-unity-paris) created for Ubisoft's mega-franchise *Assassin's Creed: Unity*, the French people have not only centimeter-level measurements, but also an entire interactive, atmospheric representation of Notre-Dame to reference as they rebuild.
