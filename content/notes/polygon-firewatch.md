title: 'Polygonâ€™s Review of Firewatch: 8.5/10'

Colin Campbell, [reporting for Polygon][polygon]: 

> Delilah and Henry represent an emerging trend in games, of paired characters who are individually and collectively simpatico but who struggle with their own anxieties and with one another's perceived shortcomings. Their relationship has form and shape, though it shimmers and shifts as the story progresses.

> These two characters are written with a conviction and authenticity rarely seen in video games. Neither of them is idealized, not even for a second. Their self-doubts and flaws are carved into the script and into the optional responses. Their ordinariness is what makes them so appealing.

The echoing refrain I've heard about _Firewatch_ is that it's very well written, and the voice acting is just great.
