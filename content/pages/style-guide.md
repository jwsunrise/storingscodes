### Working title: Web Elements of Style

This document is both an in-progress draft of some short, practical opinions on what makes good written web markup and a personalized list of editorial decisions that are a superset of those found in the _New York Times Manual of Style_. The goal here is to bring a consistent voice to all the writing on this site.

Please feel free to remix or copy the contents here for your own personal use. A link back to this page is appreciated, but not required. This document will continue to evolve over time, so check back occasionally.


## Ideology

If you do any sort of writing, particularly online, you should be using a style guide. Having some sort of reference for how _you_ write will help you make consistent editorial decisions, and it will help bring a level of polish to your work that many miss out on.


## Style & tone

Go read "[The Elements of Style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elements_of_Style)" by Strunk & White. Brevity and clarity are paramount. Try to avoid didactic language. Write with purpose.

Establish the context of a person, place, or thing without making the reader feel stupid. Ex. "K.Q. Dreger, a writer from Ohio, created the Audacious Fox Style Guide, a resource he hopes is copied by bloggers everywhere." Don't be a jerk. Always make it clear who and where you're quoting from. Quote things _exactly_ as they appear.

> "Be sparing with quotes. Direct quotes should be used when either the speaker or what he said is surprising, or when the words he used are particularly pithy or graphic. Otherwise you can probably paraphrase him more concisely." — [Economist Style Guide][esg]

## A note on permalinks

Less is more. Strip the trailing slash and file extensions from any URLs (e.g. `/title` not `/title.html` or `/title/`) and avoid adding in extra cruft like extraneous dates or words. Keep permalinks short, but not so devoid of context that someone looking at the bare URL would struggle to identify what the linked-to content might be about. 

## A note on links

Links are one of the most important differentiators between paper and webpages. Links combine context and citation into one user-friendly element. Unfortunately, many links wrap the incorrect part of a sentence, which makes them feel off-putting. 

Generally, a link should start its anchor with the verb that immediately precedes the main subject of the linked content and continue until the end of the clause.

✅ [In his book on the stock market](#), Mr. Dreger wrote about the fall of the 2008 market.

✅ In his book on the stock market, Mr. Dreger [wrote about the fall of the 2008 market](#)

Avoid linking to entire sentences or independent clauses. These _run-on_ links are both aesthetically unappealing and sloppy markup.

❌ [In his book on the stock market, Mr. Dreger wrote about the fall of the 2008 market.](#)

❌ In his book on the stock market, [Mr. Dreger wrote about the fall of the 2008 market.](#)

In certain situations, especially when linking to definitions or individual works like movies, books, or music, anchor the link as closely to the subject as possible: 

✅ While looking up dictionary terms, Mr. Dreger came across the term [onomatopoeia](#).

✅ The [reviews for "La La Land"](#) are out.
