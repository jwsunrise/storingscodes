Short and sweet: 

* You use this website and everything hosted here at your own risk. Anything you download to your computer is also done so at your own risk. 
* All linked to websites are thoroughly vetted; however, if you visit anything not hosted at audaciousfox.net, the liability changes to adhere to those listed in the privacy policy and terms of that website. 

## Ads

I do not run any third-party advertisements.  

## Analytics

I use an analytics service called [Clicky](https://clicky.com) to review how many people have visited, where they might be coming from, and what types of devices they could be using. As of June 2018, I'm looking to migrate off of Clicky and on to a service that allows for better anonymization of the data they collect. Truly, the only reason I want to know about my visitors at all is to help me understand (a) where *Audacious* might be getting linked to from and (b) what sort of devices I need to consider when making design changes. I don't care about most of the other data, and — as mentioned above — I'm actively looking to move to a less accurate service. 

## Cloud.Typography

*Audacious* uses a webfont provided by Hoefler & Co. through a service called Cloud.typography. However, this service does not use cookies or JavaScript to serve the font files, and the only information collected by Cloud.typography is used to manage my billing with Hoefler & Co. For more information, you can read the terse [Cloud.typography declaration][hco], which enumerates what data they collect and why.

## Communications 

Unless I ask you for permission, anything you email me will be kept anonymous. Speaking of, please [email me](/masthead) if you have any questions.
