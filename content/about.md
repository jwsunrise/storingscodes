## Hardware

My main machine is a Lenovo ThinkPad T420 from 2011. It runs Linux Mint 20. It has a Intel i5-2520M, 8gb of RAM and a 128gb SSD. It's old, but a great machine to tinker with. For the mouse, I use a Logitech MX Master 2.

My phone is a iPhone 8+ from 2017. It runs the latest beta of iOS 14. It still runs as fine as the day I got it, so no reason to upgrade (besides the fact that it's too big...).

## Software

As of september 2020 I'm running Linux Mint 20 as my main operating system. I'm not sure what to do when it comes to window managers yet.

I mostly use Firefox, because everything can be done in a browser today.
