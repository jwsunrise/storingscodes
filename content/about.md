I’m Jan-Willem Boelens.

I’m 39 years old, live in Rotterdam and have a cat. His name is Bob. He thinks he is a dog.

When I am not sleeping or thinking about sleep, I ride my bike or try to take half decent photographs. Someday I will build a website for my photos, today is not that day…

I don’t have any social media accounts.

This website is built with Hugo. It is stored on Amazon S3, and Cloudfront does some things as well.

I like to keep this website as light as possible. Speed is key. Websites that take 30 seconds to load must die.

Also no trackers and cookies.
