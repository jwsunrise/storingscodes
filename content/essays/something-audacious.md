For a while now, I have wanted to stop writing at [kyledreger.com](http://kyledreger.com).

I love writing, and I think it helps me work through my own thoughts. However, I have always wanted to write in a place that didn't scream "me." I wanted a place where I could grow the brand beyond myself. 

Some thoughts:

1. This is the web column I want to read. It will feature articles and musings at the intersection of art and technology.
2. I want this site to be profitable, which won't take too much. However, goals are good, and I want this site to be in the black, _within_ a year.
3. I love reader feedback, and I strongly encourage you to send me any of your thoughts (or counter arguments) with the [email on this page](/about).

As always, thanks for reading, and I hope you enjoy this new space. I sure do.
