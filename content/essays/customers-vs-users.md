title: "Customers, Not Users"

A lot of software isn't free. Plenty of people pay to use products. Yet, we call these people *users* in most of our copy and internal communications. Should we?

What if we tried calling them what they actually are: *customers*. 

* User story becomes customer story. 
* User review becomes customer review. 
* User issue becomes customer issue. 

I think the difference is important. Facebook has users. We have customers. By referring to your customers *as* customers, you're respecting the fact that someone is paying you for your work. We don't need to sell customer dataâ€”their hard-earned dollars keep us running. Also, a sentence like "15 minutes of downtime" hits harder when you know it's a customer on the other end. 

You can argue that both paying and non-paying people are subsets of the generic *user*. And certainly, your company culture plays a larger role in whether you respect your customers (or users) than the terminology.

But I still think there's something here. Someone, somewhere is paying us for our products. That's a difference worth distinguishing.
