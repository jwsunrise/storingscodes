I've noticed an interesting (growing?) trend over the past few years. Some bloggers (or their designers) choose to hide *when* a post was written. I usually see this via dates excluded from the URL and/or the page itself. Why they're doing this, I'm not sure. 

For URLs, I think dates are useful. Take this URL for example: 

/2019/dont-hide-the-date

Just looking at it, you have a sense of when it was written and what it might be about. Instantly. That's a good user experience. 

(My favorite URL approach is from sites like Medium, where they opt for the questionable /title-GI83R1SH article ID at the end of their post URLs which manages to thread the needle of being both impossible to guess and devoid of any date context. I call this URL style post-modern, because what starts out understandable quickly turns convoluted.)

But I understand not wanting extra cruft in your URLs. Having a clean website.com/post-title structure is attractive to my inner minimalist. Going title-only also makes it easier to recall the URL of a once-visited post, since you're more likely to guess the title of an article than the title and date.

Then there's the date on the page itself. I generally see a lot of designs use the smallest type size or the faintest gray color possible—if they even include the date at all. I think that's the wrong way to go. Whether the post is timely or timeless, dates provide a sense of place and serve as an important piece of context for your readers. 

You don't have to overemphasize the *when* something was written, but please don't leave it out completely.
