title: "I Just Want To Play A Video Game..."

Two days ago I had some spare time and thought: "Lets go play some Call Of Duty on the PlayStation!"

So I fired up the ol' PS4 and ~~started playing within 2 minutes~~ had to update the game. Fine. Click update. Wait? *How* big is the update? **15GB** for 1 game update.

I have pretty fast internet, so the download doesn't take that long. But guess what? After downloading, the PS4 has to copy the file to god knows where. That alone takes about 30 minutes. I have a PS4 Pro. Why does it take that long to copy a game update?

By now my interest to play a quick game is completely gone. I let the PS4 update and do something else.

So, today I thought again: "Lets go play some Call Of Duty on the PlayStation!"

So I fired up the PS4 and "you've got to be kidding me..." another freaking update. This time it's *only* 2GB, but again copying the file takes about 20 minutes or so.

Why can't I just play a quick game online and shoot some people and go on with my day? 17GB of updates in 2 days is just dumb.

I know I can keep the PS4 connected and let it update by itself, but I don't want to keep the PS4 on.
