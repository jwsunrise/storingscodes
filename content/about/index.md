## Hardware

My main machine is PC with a AMD Ryzen 5 3600, 16GB of RAM and a 1TB NVMe M.2 SSD.  It runs Windows 10, which I hate. But with a 4k monitor, I have found no Linux distro that runs smooth. Mint 20.  For the mouse, I use a Logitech MX Master 2.

My phone is a Nokia 7.1. It's small, light and has USB-C.
