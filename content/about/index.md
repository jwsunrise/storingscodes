Hi, I'm Jan-Willem Boelens. I'm 40 years old, have a cat named Bob and hate Facebook. I have no need for a website, but here we are.

During the day I work at Sunrise Medical, where I build stuff for the web. At night, I dream about pizza.

## Hardware

My main machine is PC with a AMD Ryzen 5 3600, 16GB of RAM and a 1TB NVMe M.2 SSD.  It runs Windows 10, which I hate. But with a 4k monitor, I have found no Linux distro that runs smooth. Mint 20.  For the mouse, I use a Logitech MX Master 2.

My phone is a Nokia 7.1. It's small, light and has USB-C.

## Colophon

This website lives on <a href="https://github.com/jwboelens/blog">Github</a>. Everytime I add or change something, Netlify does it's magic.

No javascript (well, besides the menu), no cookies, no trackers and no bloat. I don't care who visits my website.
