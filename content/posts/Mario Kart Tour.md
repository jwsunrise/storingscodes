Why the hell would you pay 5 dollar **a month** for a 200CC mode in Mario Kart?? There is no controller support and you can only play it in portrait mode.

> Rather amusingly, one of the in-app purchase options is a $4.99 subscription for extra items … the same price as Apple Arcade’s entire 100-game library.
