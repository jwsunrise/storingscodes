Yesterday I installed iOS 13 on my iPhone 8+. I also started the Apple Arcade trial.

As with all mobile games: *touch controls suck*. A lot. I played these games with my PS4 controller. Pairing it with my iPhone took 10 seconds: press the PS button and the share button on your controller at the same time, and hold it for a few seconds. Open the bluetooth settings on your phone and click on the Dualshock controller. Thats it. Highly recommend it. It makes playing these games a lot more fun.

### Skate City
Mwah. Looks good. Feels a bit boring after 15 minutes of playing. Still waiting for a good skateboard game...

### Sayonara 
This games looks amazing! The sound is great, and the controls are great also. There is only one problem: I don't quite know what is going on all the time on the screen. I will be playing this game more the coming days.

### Mini Motorways  
Mmmm. I'm not sure about this one. Visuals are cool. But I think it's more suitable for the iPad or on a TV screen.
