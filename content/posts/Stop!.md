Stop scrolljacking! For the love of all that is holy, please stop it. My laptop fans go crazy with your damn animations. Look at this new Pixel website: <a href="https://store.google.com/us/product/pixel_5?hl=en-US">Pixel 5</a>. All I see is weird stutter and no information about the product. Please designers, don't do it.
