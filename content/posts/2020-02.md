### TV

- The Man in the High Castle  

S02 / S03 / S04

What a fantastic show! In the first couple of episodes I thought it was some kind of love story or something.
But it turned in to some sci-fi stuff I absolutely love.

### Movies

- Ready Player One

Read the book, liked it. Saw the movie in the cinema, left halfway, dit not like it at all.
It's on Netflix now, so gave it another change. Nope. Still don't like it.
