# I Don’t Care Anymore

Watched the Apple keynote last week. The more I think about it, the more I find it completely  baffling that I watched an hour long commercial from the biggest company in the world.

New tablets, new watches. I just don't care anymore. Maybe it's an age thing, but I just want my stuff to work and when it does, there is no reason to upgrade. I'm still on my iPhone 8+ from 2017 and it works the same as the day I got it. The pricing of all these things plays a big role as well. 429 euro for a new watch is a lot of money. For what? Notifications on my wrist and I have to charge it everyday. No thanks. Did you know the woven nylon-like band for the new watch is 99 euros. For a watch band. That's absurd. And they removed the charger ~~to make more money~~ to save the environment. Which is a nice thing of Apple to do.
