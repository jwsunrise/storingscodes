			<h1>I Just Want To Play A Video Game...</h1>
				<p>Two days ago I had some spare time and thought: &ldquo;Lets go play some Call Of Duty on the PlayStation!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So I fired up the ol&rsquo; PS4 and <del>started playing within 2 minutes</del> had to update the game. Fine. Click update. Wait? <em>How</em> big is the update? <strong>15GB</strong> for 1 game update.</p>
<p>I have pretty fast internet, so the download doesn&rsquo;t take that long. But guess what? After downloading, the PS4 has to copy the file to god knows where. That alone takes about 30 minutes. I have a PS4 Pro. Why does it take that long to copy a game update?</p>
<p>By now my interest to play a quick game is completely gone. I let the PS4 update and do something else.</p>
<p>So, today I thought again: &ldquo;Lets go play some Call Of Duty on the PlayStation!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So I fired up the PS4 and &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve got to be kidding me&hellip;&rdquo; another freaking update. This time it&rsquo;s <em>only</em> 2GB, but again copying the file takes about 20 minutes or so.</p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t I just play a quick game online and shoot some people and go on with my day? 17GB of updates in 2 days is just dumb.</p>
<p>I know I can keep the PS4 connected and let it update by itself, but I don&rsquo;t want to keep the PS4 on.</p>
