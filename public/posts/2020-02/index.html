			<h1>Apple Arcade First Impression</h1>
				<p>Yesterday I installed iOS 13 on my iPhone 8+. I also started the Apple Arcade trial.</p>
<p>As with all mobile games: <em>touch controls suck</em>. A lot. I played these games with my PS4 controller. Pairing it with my iPhone took 10 seconds: press the PS button and the share button on your controller at the same time, and hold it for a few seconds. Open the bluetooth settings on your phone and click on the Dualshock controller. Thats it. Highly recommend it. It makes playing these games a lot more fun.</p>

<p>Mwah. Looks good. Feels a bit boring after 15 minutes of playing. Still waiting for a good skateboard game&hellip;</p>

<p>This games looks amazing! The sound is great, and the controls are great also. There is only one problem: I don&rsquo;t quite know what is going on all the time on the screen. I will be playing this game more the coming days.</p>

<p>Mmmm. I&rsquo;m not sure about this one. Visuals are cool. But I think it&rsquo;s more suitable for the iPad or on a TV screen.</p>
