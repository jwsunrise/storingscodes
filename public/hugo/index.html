			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I’m Jan-Willem Boelens.</p>
<p>I’m 39 years old, live in Rotterdam and have a cat. His name is Bob. He thinks he is a dog.</p>
<p>When I am not sleeping or thinking about sleep, I ride my bike or try to take half decent photographs. Someday I will build a website for my photos, today is not that day…</p>
<p>I don’t have any social media accounts.</p>

<p>This website is built with Hugo. It is stored on Amazon S3, and Cloudfront does some things as well.</p>
<p>I like to keep this website as light as possible. Speed is key. Websites that take 30 seconds to load must die.</p>
<p>Also no trackers and cookies.</p>
